6WKk8l8EXiwPBYlmSlhZWx,yeah i got off stage like a month ago i was talking to fans and one of em pulled me aside and said we never met but i swear that you know who i am i ve been through a lot i don t know how to express it to people don t think that i can but i got that mansion cd on rotation that s real for me nate you do not understand it s crazy for me kids hit me up say they slittin they wrists on the daily this music is more than you think don t book me for just entertainment it s entertainin hearin these parents they telling their kids my music is violent you gotta be kidding me i guess that your definition of violence and mine is something that we look at differently how do you picture me huh want me to smile you want me to laugh you want me to walk on the stage with a smile on my face when i m mad and put on a mask for real though i mean what you expect from me i m tryna do this respectfully they say that life is a race i knew my problems would prolly catch up eventually i do my best to be calm how you gon write me and tell me you d slaughter my family that s just a glimpse to the stuff that gets sent to me these are the parts of my life they don t never see woo i am aware it s aggressive i am not here for acceptance i don t know what you expected but what you expect when you walk in a therapy session huh therapy therapy session therapy therapy session this girl at the show looked me in the face and told me her life s full of drama said her dad is abusive apparently he likes to beat on her mama i got so angry inside i wanted to tell her to give me his number but what you gon do with it right you gon hit him up then he ll start hittin her harder that s real these kids they come to my shows with tears in they eyes magine someone looking at you and sayin your music s the reason that they are alive sometimes i don t know how to handle it this type of life isn t glamorous this ain t an act for the cameras you see me walk on these stages but have no idea what i m dealing with after it nah i put it all in the open this is the way that i cope with all my emotion i m taking pictures with thousands of people but honestly i feel like nobody knows me i m tryin to deal with depression i m tryin to deal with the pressure how you gon tell me my music does not have a message when i m lookin out at this crowd full of people i know i affected agh i got some things in my life i know i should let em go let me jot it down let me take a mental note i put it all in this microphone think about that for a minute what is the point of this song i m just ventin but what you expect from a therapy session huh  therapy therapy session therapy therapy session what you think about me that doesn t worry me i know i handle some things immaturely i know that i need to grow in maturity i ain t gon walk on these stages in front of these people and act like i live my life perfectly that doesn t work for me christian is not the definition of what perfect means woo i ain t the type to be quiet i ain t gon sit here in silence if i wouldn t say what i say to your face then i promise you i wouldn t say it in private i am not lyin people go off on my page and i m tryin to quit the replyin but this is ridiculous i m passionate man i really mean what i m writing you want me to keep it a hundred okay i ll keep it a hundred i see a whole lot of talkin on socials but honestly i don t see nothing in public i kinda love it yeah why don t you write us some happy raps that would be awesome all of your music is moody and dark nate don t get me started you wanna know what it s like if you met me in person listen to my verses this music is not just for people who sit in the pews and pray at the churches nah i won t reject it i don t expect everyone to respect it i don t expect you to get my perspective but what you expect from a therapy session huh i mean i think sometimes people they confuse what i m doin i write about life i write about things that i m actually dealing with something that i m actually experiencing this is real for me like this is something that personally helps me as well i m not confused about who gave me the gift god gave me the gift and he gave me the ability to to do this and he also gave me this as an outlet and that s what music is for me when i feel something whether it s anger um it s a passion about something or frustration like this is where i go this is this is that s the whole nf real music thing man this is real for me i need this this is a therapy for me88,"[-4.657405853271484, -5.133537292480469,
