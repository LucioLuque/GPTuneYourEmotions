Watching my teammate stay late to coach the interns after hours left me genuinely inspired.,as i pondered the thought of evolving as an artist i was inside of my office meditating in the darkness an uncomfortable pounding was hitting in my chest when the patient walked in i was sitting at my desk as my thought reached his height the room became bright then i stood up and slapped him for turning on the light then i told him to be seated as he started to explain how the negative influences had targeted his brain the ratchetness defeated my ability to fight it i know that it s atrocious but somehow i ve grown to like it in one minute i deciphered the symptoms shut up and listen you ve been poisoned and conditioned through audio repetition and media false religions and visual exhibitions the medicine to the sickness requires no prescription i opened up a cabinet a container was revealed then i told him to be still lay back and take this pill what are you tryna do i m going to deprogram you what are you going to do i m going to deprogram you no just let me go i can t stand you doctor damn you you ll thank me when i m through just let me deprogram you it was obvious his mind was rejecting cause he was choking three seconds after he took it his body started convulsing i ve been doing this for years i m trained i m not a novice so i recognized quickly an exorcism was in progress the process wasn t clean he was harder to redeem this was one of the most extreme cases i d ever seen i expected little resistance but never a rejecter hooked his brain up to this thing that showed his thoughts on a projector screen every idea and dream he ever dreamed told my secretary jean to bring me a nectarine as i ate it i sat back and let the method take it s course it rewound back eventually landing at the source when the needle spiked hard i got anxious i saw how the dangerous language came through his subconscious chambers initiating gradual changes that were rendering him brainless the power blew and shorted out the main switch what are you tryna do i m going to deprogram you what are you going to do i m going to deprogram you no just let me go i can t stand you doctor damn you you ll thank me when i m through just let me deprogram you  my maintenance coordinator powered the generator then i placed him into great situational simulator filled his conscience with both beneficial and nonsense featured good and evil and monitored his responses with weaker content his vessel paraded about anything positive he regurgitated it out i leaned over the table to scream don t let it break you this fake music was specially designed to overtake you the superficial nature of this garbage i revealed it s an audio mirage this stuff is not even real it s only a spell they sent to keep your true potential in the basement demented strategic radio placement i thought it would get better but then i saw no chances he started yelling turn up and doing funny dances he seemed to be getting worse than he was when he came in i hollered for my intern to come help me restrain him he would die if i couldn t stop the ignorance from reigning the clock was ticking down only two minutes remaining to save him i was racing but he gave no indication my track record s impeccable i ve never lost a patient so failure i never knew each second the pressure grew came to the conclusion there was only one thing left to do he s nearly a vegetable i have to handle this directly laid on the table next to him told my intern to connect me and effectively inject more intellect till he was stable similar to car batteries connected with jumper cables but if it didn t work i would lose all my brain fluid my intern said please don t i said shut up and do it when he plugged me to try it sparks flew from the wires the lights were flicking on and off the room was on fire and purple communication after that was non verbal the screen said total completion of transferral the course had ran thorough but something was still concerning in silence both of us were laid motionless on the gurney the patient s eyes opened as the sun beamed through the window my team started removing the chords from our temples he raised up and said he was healed the method s proven they waited for me to respond still i wasn t moving they entertained the thought that i had let my tactics break me they did everything in their power to resuscitate me one of them read the bible as i laid there idle and multiple devices were used to check the vitals they shocked me medicated me but still wasn t recovering they worked to bring me back a whole hour but still nothing then grateful for my sacrifice and all of my devotion they drove me 700 miles and placed me in the ocean i floated out to sea as they cried and started grieving they stayed the entire evening said some words before leaving they travelled home mourning the demise of the doctor returned to the facility to empty out their lockers they came back to the building walked inside and nearly lost it looked down the hall and saw me watching tv in my office drinking a cup of coffee relaxed trying to chill as the patient tried to hug me i just handed him the bill everyone was like we thought you had suffered sure disaster i said yes i know that s why you re the students and i m the master now get back to work 4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not align with the user's emotional state of feeling inspired by a teammate's dedication. The song's narrative about a doctor attempting to deprogram a patient using extreme and surreal methods does not fit the context of mentorship or inspiration.

The courier dumped my brand-new keyboard in a puddle and walked off—I'm fuming.,youre the one that made me have to walk away you tried to compromise and make me change my ways you left me cold and ive got nothing more to say you left me dry and ive got nothing more to say1,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of betrayal and abandonment, which aligns with the user's feelings of frustration and anger towards the courier's careless behavior. However, the song seems to focus more on a personal or emotional relationship rather than a specific incident involving negligence or carelessness, which reduces its contextual relevance. The lyrics are fairly coherent, maintaining a clear narrative of being left alone and disappointed, though they do not perfectly match the specific scenario of the user."

and on genius alfred lin i ll set the stage with some slides and a few comments but the main stage is going to be with brian when he comes up and talks about how he built the airbnb culture so you are here you have been following the presentations so you know how to get started you have built a team you know how to build your product its off the ground it s growing people love it you figured out how to do that you figured out to create a special one of a kind company with monopoly powers thats big and the market you are chasing after is slightly bigger than the paper airplane business so you are good right so now what so we are here to submit that actually culture is the thing that is actually going to be very very important to scale the business as well as your team and hopefully after this talk you will be able to know what is culture why does it matter how do you create your core values and think about elements that fit together for core values and culture that create a high performance team get some best practices for the culture what is culture anybody want to take a guess at how one should define this yeah thats good did you look that up because you had a computer and an internet connection these are some definitions that you will find in websters dictionary but we are stanford this is kind of a trick question its a cs class the questions are never straight forward the real question is what is the company culture going to be culture we can generally talk about society about groups about places or things here we re talking about company culture so how does one define company culture we can take the previous definition and modify it a little bit this is a hint of how we may want to define company culture every day blank and blank of each member of the team in pursuit of our company blank some people have filled these in with different things the first blank a could be assumptions beliefs values now my favorite is core values the second blank for the b blank people said behavior my favorite is action how do you act in pursuit of goals thats kind of weak in pursuit of big and hairy audacious goals is a little stronger but a better definition is in the pursuit of mission so now that we have that definition what do we do with that and why does it matter this is a quote from gandhi your beliefs become your thoughts your thoughts become your words your words become your actions your actions become the habits your habits become your values and your values become your destiny if you don t have a good culture in the company you cant pursue your destiny why it matters is that it becomes the first principles you sort of go back to when you make decisions it becomes a way to align people on values that matter to the company it provides a certain level of stability to fall back on and it provides level of trust people sort of trust each other with but it also gives us a list with which you should be able to figure out what to do and what not to do and what the more important thing about that is what not to do then finally the other thing that is important is it allows you to retain the right employees there are people in this world that are not going to be a fit for your company but if you have good strong culture and the strong core values you ll know who you want to retain and who you truly do not want to retain and if you take the first letter of those it happens to help you move faster another reason you re thinking that s like all mushy stuff this is actually more scientific stuff so here are indices from 1994 to 2013 stock market indices of companies in the s p500 and the russell 3000 and the fortune 100 best companies to work for all these companies out there and they picked out companies that they believed were the best companies to work for the stock market returns of those companies happen to be 11 8 which is almost twice that of the other two indices and so there is real power in companies that treat their employees well where there s a lot of trust there is a lot of strong culture so how do you create a set of values and define the culture etc get asked that a lot you have to start with the leader of the company and the founder and ask yourself what are the values that are the most important to you of those things that are most important in the business who are the types of people you like working with and what are their values and through that you distill together what a set of values are think about all the people that you ve never liked working with what values do they have think of the opposite of that maybe those should be considered values for your company finally remember the values have to support your mission and if they don t support your mission youre missing something then the last final checks are they have to be creditable they have to be uniquely tied to match your mission so at zappos in terms of uniquely applied to the mission we were focused on creating a culture that was going to provide great customer service so the first core value we had was to deliver wow through service we are very specific that we wanted to deliver great customer service and it was going to be a wow experience and then below that we wanted to serve i had a paragraph talking about what we mean by that we wanted to support them doing the wow through service and support people such as our employees our customers our brand partners and investors on terms of the opposite thing we generally didnt like working with arrogant people so one of our core values at zappos was to be humble so those are two examples where we create core values in a way that became credible and uniquely tied to our mission so you go through this process you come up with a few core values these might be some of them whether it s honesty integrity service teamwork it might be a list you might start with three might end up with a list of ten you might have a list of thirty its a good start when zappos went through this process we asked all the employees at the time what core values they can identify with and they came up with thirty seven we whittled that down to about ten and it took a year to do this that s a long time and you might want to ask why well if you just come up with the word honesty give me a break everybody wants the culture to be honest nobody is going to say i want to be lied to every day service what do you mean by service theres got to be a lot more depth in this than that and everybody talks about teamwork but there s a difference in level of teamwork that you see in an intramural sports team vs a baseball team how do you dive deeper into teamwork what are the things that don t work for a team a lot of it has to do with communication a lot has to do with things that people of study and you may one go deeper into that at zappos we thought about well there are a lot of smart people in this room when they re fighting with each other and trying to figure out who s right and who s not its probably not the best use of time we wanted everyone to build off each other and help each other make any idea better the result is that the company gets a better idea not that any individual person is right so we wanted to make and still this idea that it s company first then your department then your the team then yourself and how do you do that we are going to go a level deeper in that there s another great element of high performing teams that i really like which is this pyramid that was created by patrick lencioni and he wrote this book the five dysfunctions of a team and the reason this is interesting is he talks about the breakdowns of the team a lot of teams break down because they have no trust and even if you had trust why do you need trust if you have trust you can actually have debates and conflict and get to the right answer if you don t have conflicts and debate it s the blind leading the blind how do you actually know you got to the right answer before you commit to something so people are not actually wanting to commit they re afraid of committing lets say you get to the next level when you are actually able to commit what goes wrong then it s usually because people are not held accountable to things that they committed to and if people are not held accountable to the things that they committed to then they cant get results if you think about the company as a black box and results whether it s financial whether you produce a great product or anything like that as the output one of the major inputs is the culture of the company some other best practices we are actually going to talk though in the q and a because i think they are going to blend into the conversation is that you want to incorporate your mission into your values we talked about that performance you need to think a bit harder deeper longer about your values than you might initially think you need to one of the things i think a lot of companies don t actually do is they interview for technical fit or skill fit a competency in that realm but they dont actually interview for the culture fit whether someone will actually believe in and follow the mission i think that is a big big no no i think you can have the smartest engineer in the world but if they don t believe the mission they are not going to pour their heart and soul into it and that s one of the things where if you actually start thinking about culture from the interview process to performance reviews to making sure thats a daily habit you get a lot further with making a great culture one final point made here culture just like customer service or fitness is like motherhood and apple pie everybody wants to provide great customer service every company wants to have great culture what they fail to do is make it a daily habit you just can t be fit if you don t do it as a daily habit eventually you get out of shape then you get fat and then you say oh i have to go on a crash diet to get back into shape that doesn t quite work and the same is true with something like culture so i think we checked all of these off so we can go into q and a with brian brian chesky hello everybody its quiet in here i ll be honest now i feel a little less on edge nothing worse than a room full of people really really quiet staring at you but now i feel better alfred lin well i did it for five or ten minutes you can do it a little longer so brian could you talk about the process by which you came to understand that culture was important to airbnb and building a company brian chesky yeah so i think one of the things we realized is to just give you i wont tell the full story of how airbnb came to be some of you may know it so heres the very short version the story airbnb wasn t meant to be the company we were trying to start i quit my job i was living in la one day i drove to san francisco became roommates with my friend from college from the rhode island school of design joe gebbia and i had one thousand dollars in the bank and the rent was one thousand one hundred and fifty dollars so that weekend this international design convention was coming to san francisco all the hotels were sold out so we decided to turn the house into a bed and breakfast for the conference i didnt have a bed joe had three air beds we pulled them out of the closet and called it the air bed and breakfast that s how the company started i recall the story ten thousand times by the way some version of that story and i didn t think i d ever tell that a second time i remember growing up i also went to college my parents were social workers and never thought about me going to art school they had worried that maybe i would not get a job after college which im sure most parents worry about make sure you promise me you get a job with health insurance i end up starting airbnb i remember her telling me i guess you never got the job with health insurance the reason i say this though is airbnb was never meant to be the big idea it was meant to be the thing to pay the rent so we could think of the big idea along the way by solving our problem it became the big idea so alongside that we wont touch on how we built a product that s probably another conversation that s being talked about you have to build a team and a great company and in the early days we had three co founders joe nate and myself i think of one of the reasons we re successful was that i was really lucky i don t think it was really lucky to pick up the idea airbnb and i dont think we were lucky to be successful once we had a team i think we could have come up with a lot of other ideas and been just as successful i think i was lucky in that i found two great people that i wanted to start up a business with people i admired that almost intimidated me by how smart they were i think that s what the first thing is to build a team that is so talented that they kind of slightly make you uncomfortable to be with them because you know you are going to have to raise your game to be with them and then when we were working together in the early days this is 2008 the first thing is we were like a family you think about founders like parents and the company like a child that child will manifest in many ways behaviors that parents have in the relationship if the parents are functional but not working together then the child is frankly going to be pretty fucked up you dont want that you want your culture to be awesome and so joe nate and i were a total family the beginning we usually worked eighteen hours a day seven days a week i remember when we were at y combinator we worked together we ate food together or even went to the gym together we may as well have gotten jumpsuit we didnt go that far it was like we were a mission a special force we had this amazing shared way of doing things with amazing accountability and that was the dna of a company and then we were thinking at some point you build the product to phase two which is building the company that builds the product so a lot of the talk is about how to build a product how to get product market fit once people do that now you have to build a company it doesn t matter how great your original product idea is if you cannot build a great company then your product will not endure as we thought about this we realized we wanted to build a company for the long term we wanted a company that would endure to do that we started noticing companies have something in common companies around for a really long time had a clear mission a clear sense of values and they had a shared way of doing something that was unique to them and was really special and so joe nate and i when we were three people decided to look around at companies i noticed apple steve jobs core value was that he believed people with passion could change the world he said our products change but our value never has we learned about amazon we learned about nike we learned about companies in the early days you can even use this to talk about nations even a nation has core values and a declaration so that the nation may endure longer we started to realize that we needed to have intention culture needs to be designed and that is how we got connected because we were funded by sequoia alfred just joined them with zappos and i was told zappos had an amazing culture we went to las vegas and met up with tony and we learned about it alfred lin so what did you learn brian chesky well you guys are crazy the thing we learned and we were three people was if culture is a way of doing things there really are two arts one is behaviors and those can change maybe fifty years from now there will be rituals and behaviors that change be different but there have to be some things that never change some principles some ideas that endure that make you you and i think of core values integrity honesty those arent core values those are values that everyone should have but there have to be like three five six things that are unique to you and you can probably think about this in your life what is different about you that every single other person if you could only tell them three or four things you would want them to know about you and we realized that when zappos was one hundred employees they wrote down these ten core values the thing i learned from tony is i wish i didnt wait until i was one hundred employees to write down a core value i was talking to sam he thinks we are the only company to write our core values down before we hired anyone alfred lin how long did it take you to hire your first employee brian chesky so the first employee was our first engineer i think we looked for him for four or five months i probably looked through thousands of people and interviewed hundreds of people alfred lin by then when you hired him when did you write it was it on day one or two or was it three brian chesky i think we started working on it around the time of y combinator which would ve been january 2009 it was probably a process that evolved over the course of six to seven months we finished y combinator in april 2009 hired our first engineer in july something like that probably six months some people ask why did you spend so much time on hiring your first engineer i think bringing in your first engineer is like bringing in a dna chip to the company this person if we re successful there were going to be a thousand people just like him or her in that company it still wasn t a matter of getting somebody to build the next three features we need the ship for users there was something much more long term and much more enduring which was do i want to work with one hundred thousand more people like this now you want diversity to play you want diversity of background age you don t want diversity of values you want very homogenous beliefs thats the one thing that shouldnt be diverse alfred lin so what were these values brian chesky six core values ill talk about maybe three of them so the first core value we talk about is champion in mission and what it really means is that we want to hire people that are here for a mission we dont want people here because they think we have a great valuation they like our office design they need a job or they think its hot we want people to be here for the one thing that will never change and thats our mission and just to tell you a quick story about our mission airbnb a lot of people describe it as a way to book a room or book a house and travel around the world and thats what we do but that is not why we do it to answer the question on what our mission is is to tell you a story i think it describes it in 2012 i met a host named sebastian we do these new jobs around the world where we do meet ups sebastian is probably late fifties in north london sebastian looks at me and says brian there is this word you never use on your website and i say what s that word and he says that word is friendship i would love to read a story about friendship i said okay read me a story about friendship he says six months ago the brunt of riots broke out in front of my home and i was very scared the next day my mom called me to make sure i was ok i said yeah mom im ok and she goes what about the house he says the house is ok as well he said here s the interesting thing from the time the riots broke out to the time my mom called me was a twenty four hour window of time in the periods between that time seven of my previous airbnb guests called me just to make sure i was okay he said think about that seven of my own guests called me before my own mother did i think that says more about his mother than his guests but in this summer on a typical night or a peak night we wouldhave four hundred twenty five thousand people staying in homes and living together and they were coming from a hundred and ninety different countries in the world which is every country except north korea iran syria cuba so just hearing that story at our core that is what we are about thats much more than just booking a room or traveling that what we are about is we want to help bring the world together we want to do that by giving a sense of belonging anywhere you go our mission is to belong anywhere so five years from now twenty years from now maybe we re still selling rooms and homes to meet in or not but i can guarantee you we re always going be about a sense of belonging and bringing people together and that s the more enduring idea so when we hire people the first thing to make sure it is that if that is your mission you need to champion your mission you champion the mission by living the mission do you believe in it do you have stories about it do you use the product do you believe in the product i used to ask crazy questions one of the crazy questions sam reminds me of i use to interview people so i interviewed the first three hundred employees at airbnb which people think im really neurotic and they may also be true i used to ask them a question if you had a year left to live would you take this job i amended it people who say yes probably don t like their families so i changed it to ten years i feel like you should use whatever time you have left to live whatever you want to do in those last ten years you should just do i really want you to think about that that was enough time for you to do something you really cared about and the answer doesn t have to be this company i say fine if what youre meant to do is travel or start a company just do that don t come here go do that so there is this old parable about two men laying bricks somebody comes up to the first man and says what are you doing im building a wall he asks the other guy he says im building a cathedral there s a job and there is a calling we want to hire people not only looking for jobs but a calling and that s the first value champion the mission i dont want to take all the time i will talk about just one more the second value relates to being frugal and i will tell you a story by the way all the founding stories of your company end up becoming the things that you keep talking about to thousands of people kind of like a child that these things keep coming back later in life so airbnb i think marc andreessen said in the last talk that it was the worst idea that ever worked i remember people thinking we were crazy i remember telling people about the idea i actually told paul graham i said we have this idea its called airbnb he asked people are actually doing this i said yeah question was what s wrong with them so i knew the interview wasn t going well and in the interview paul graham i think wasn t going to accept us and we told the story of how we funded the company and here s how it goes we re introduced michael seibel who is a partner of y combinator introduced me and joe to like fifteen investors in the valley including some of the ones that have been here and all of them said no to the company they could have bought ten percent of the company for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars they all said no they thought it was crazy no one would ever stay in someone s home so we ended up funding the company with credit cards and you know those binders kids in school put baseball cards in we had to put them in those we had to put them somewhere thats how many credit cards we had and we were completely in debt and in the fall of 2008 we provided housing for the democratic and republican national convention we had this crazy idea because we weren t selling a lot of homes in the year after we launched we had a hundred people a day visiting our website and two bookings which is generally bad its like releasing a song and a year later three people are listing to it a day its probably not going to be a very popular song but i believed in it joe and nate believed in it so we are completely in debt right and we get this idea we are an air bed and breakfast providing housing for the democratic republican national convention what if we made a breakfast cereal for like the democratic national convention and we came up with this obama themed cereal and we called it obama os the breakfast of change then we came up with a republican themed cereal for john mccain we found out he was a captain in the navy so we came up with captain mccains a maverick in every bite we had zero dollars and without any money we tried calling general mills they told us to stop calling them or they would get a restraining order so that didn t work we found a local though an alumni of risd who made a thousand boxes deal for us we ended up sending them to press and eventually within a week it got on national television national news we made forty thousand dollars selling breakfast cereal in 2008 we made five thousand dollars from our website and we made forty thousand dollars selling breakfast cereal i remember my mom asking so are a you cereal company now and that wasn t that bad part the bad part was the honest answer which was technically yes but the reason i tell that is our second core value is to be a cereal entrepreneur i m sorry for the cheesy pun but be a cereal entrepreneur we really mean is that we believe constraints bring out the creativity when you raise eight hundred million dollars suddenly all that scrappiness it s easy to lose that scrappiness its easier for people to tell you i just need this fifty thousand dollar contract i need this i need that when people are desperate and not being a little bit frugal not being creative or tell me they can t do something i ll just take a box of cereal and even the suggestion of obama os is you need to be scrappy and frugal so again a lot of the founding dna of your company becomes these values these principles everyone knows that if you don t give a crap you shouldn t be here and it doesn t mean you have to give a crap it just means you have to to be here you also have to be creative to be an entrepreneur and super scrappy and these are some of the values we learned alfred lin so you guys should start to think about questions when we open up to questions from the audience but i have a few more questions to ask so this all sounds nice stories are great the people here are a pretty skeptical group its a cs department class probably left brain focused this feels like a softie right brain focus how does having a strong culture help you make important tough decisions brian chesky well i think that having it so here s the thing about culture there are three things they never tell you about culture first thing is they never tell you anything about culture no one talks about culture and no one ever tells the need to have strong culture so there s tons of articles about building a great product there s tons of articles on growth and adaption and a few things about culture its a mystical thing that s soft and fuzzy that s the first problem the second problem is it is hard to measure things that are hard to measure often get discounted these are two very hard things the third thing the biggest problem it doesn t pay off in the short term if you wanted to start up a company and sell it in one year the one thing i would tell you to do is fuck up the culture just hire people quickly culture makes you hire really slowly makes you deliberate about your decisions that in the near term can slow progress putting an investment into the company short term first thing is the need to be very clear about what s unique to you that you stand for once you do that you need to hire people that believe in that you need to make sure you hire and fire based on these values one thing we do is constantly repeat over and over again when we interview we want to make sure they are world class and fit the culture the first thing i used to ask people at the end of the interview i would say if you can hire this is a functional question if you could hire anybody in the world would you hire the person sitting across from you if our vision is the best in the world why arent we hiring the best in the world every single person is meant to hire a person better than the previous people you are constantly raising the bar then we have separate people called core values interviewers who arent in the function so it you are an engineer the core values interviewers are never engineers because we don t want them to be biased and say well i know how good they are and they interview just for values to make sure that people care about the same thing and we said no to a lot of really great people because we just didn t feel right about them being with us long term so that s one of the things some other examples of when we have had to make hard decisions in mid 2011 we were mostly united states and we had this internet clone funded by these guys called the samwer brothers anyone ever hear of them they basically clone internet companies they recently went public they take american websites and clone them and then quickly try to sell them back to you its kind of like putting a gun to your head so they had done this to groupon groupon was the fastest growing site in the world ever they stopped doing groupon and started cloning us and this is back when we had forty employees we had raised seven million dollars they cloned us and in thirty days they hired four hundred people and they wanted to sell the company and if they couldnt they were going to destroy us around the world the problem with airbnb is if we are not everywhere around the world a travel site not being in europe is like your phone not having email it doesn t actually work so we were kind of in trouble we had this conversation it was a pragmatic decision of should we acquire them and then there was the values decision the pragmatic one probably said buy them because you can t risk losing international so just guarantee you are going to get international we ended up not buying them the reason we ended up not buying them was i just didn t like the culture i didnt want to bring in those four hundred people i felt like we were missionaries and they were mercenaries i didn t feel like they were doing it for the beliefs i thought they were doing it to make a lot of money very quickly i believed in a war missionaries would outlast and endure mercenaries i also felt like the best revenge against an internet clone was just to make them run the company long term you had the baby now you ve got to raise it so that s what we ended up doing and that was a very controversial decision a lot of people were telling me you should buy this company we didn t and i think it worked out alfred lin what percentage of revenue comes from europe brian chesky more than fifty percent alfred lin i think it worked out okay anybody have any questions i can keep going no one one statement we had at zappos is culture and brand were two sides of the same coin airbnb has a great culture and a great brand do you care to talk about branding its kind of a weak thing it s a value we don t tend to focus on brian chesky i actually just said that to sam i think silicon valley is not historically really strong or we don t talk about culture and brand very much they are two sides of the same coin so culture like the principles and the beliefs you have inside a company that you want people to be aligned with long term whatever happens inside the company eventually comes out you cant hold it in and brand is really the promise outside the company that everyone identifies with so i think having a clear mission and making sure that you know that mission and the mission comes through the company is probably the best thing you can do for both culture and values and then the second thing you know is that your brand the way people think about you and your company is often decided by your brand evangelists who are your employees if you have a weak culture we often think that companies that hire employees people that are deeply passionate create companies that customers are really passion about those are companies with strong brands and so zappos had a really strong brand a lot of companies google that cared deeply about culture they actually have a question is this person google which is meant to be like the catch all for the digital culture it was a very strong culture google has a unique there s no such thing as a good or bad culture its either a strong or weak culture and a good culture for someone else may not be a good culture for you so i think brand is incredibly important as well brand is really the connection of you with your customers and so if you have an incredibly strong culture the brand will come through the final thing to say about brand is a lot of people that talk about their brand talk about what they sell so if youre apple one way of doing the same we sell computers and the new screens are larger and faster and they talk about bits and bytes i remember steve jobs had this really important talk where he says the way to win this is 1997 isn t to talk about bits and bytes the way to win is talk about what we value what our core values are we believe passionate people can change the world and that was how they introduced a different campaign so apple before they had this huge renaissance became the most valuable company in the world they did the think different campaign which is basically saying this is what we believe in that if you buy an apple computer you re also saying i believe in this too and there has to be a deeper core belief and if that doesnt happen youre a utility and utilities get sold at commodity prices alfred lin the question is how do you know how to communicate this company culture or core value to the outside world brian chesky so the question is how do you communicate what airbnb does in the earlier days well we learned a lot because in the early days we communicated like a utility we actually said airbnb is a cheap affordable alternative to hotels our tag line was forget hotels save money with airbnb and over time we felt like that was this was way back in the day we felt like that was way too limiting that it undercut the idea we changed our tag line to travel like a human which we havent kept but it was basically meant to say that we believe in a certain kind of world and we really feel like travel is mass produced you feel isolated you feel like a stranger and we want to bring the world back to the place where it feels like a village again where the service is coming from other people where you have this feeling you belong and you are treated like a human no matter how successful you are in life often traveling will remind you that you are not that successful go through tsa stay in a typical hotel sometimes you ll have some problems we really wanted to make people feel special this is some of the stuff we did in the early days we did a lot of storytelling i mean i ve probably told the story of airbnb ten thousand times and this is a something that is kind of related to culture someone asked me the other day whats the job of the ceo there are lots of things a ceo does but what you mostly do is articulate the vision to articulate a vision you have to develop a strategy and hire people that fit the culture if you do those three things you basically have a company and that company will hopefully be successful if you have the right vision a good strategy and the people to get there and so what you end up doing is articulating the vision over and over whether its recruiting talking to investors getting funding doing pr interviews speaking in a class room you are always reinforcing the values youre doing it in an email to a customer you just do it a thousand times it changes and gets better and better every time so it kind of evolved very good question how do we make sure the hosts are reinforcing the culture of airbnb so the answer to that is we do a pretty good job but not yet an amazing job at that when we first founded airbnb i took the craig newmark school of thought craig is the founder of craigslist anyone should be able to use airbnb if you want to rent your place you should be able to it turns out many people believe in our values because we talked about them and believed them but there were people who rented on airbnb not because they believed in the values but instead because they realized they could make a lot of money renting their home and not everyone was a great culture fit these people actually did cause us a lot of problems so this was a lesson for me i didn t think it didnt occur to me in the early days that the hosts had to completely fit our values we met them we attract people like us we realized hosts are like partners and they need to believe in the same culture we do so now we have this program called the super host program where they have to demonstrate values to reach this kind of badge which gets the priority customer support and distribution we are having this important host convention where we bring all the hosts in and will be talking about reinforcing our values so the answer is we were really late but we now do it by reinforcing it every step of the way q brian airbnb has made some great contributions to the open source community do you have any thoughts on how that contributes to your culture and company values brian chesky yeah i think just in general it may be related to two things about airbnb we tend to be a pretty open culture just in general we believe in a shared world where people are giving back contributing to making communities and industries stronger its my philosophy to talk about everything internally except for things that relate to customer or client privacy if it doesnt relate to those two things then we will talk about it as far as open source culture and engineering we wanted to make sure that we had a really strong identification of the team and so we really felt like a lot of source code shouldn t be you know we felt like every company needs some kind of moat that protects you from your competition we thought some technology would be but we also felt like we wanted to give back from a technology standpoint we preferred our moat to be that we provide the very best experience in the world when you use airbnb that has the biggest network effects we thought that kind of took precedent over some of the technology that we use so we decided to try to share some of that out to people i think it does relate to the values i never recommended i never one day recommended we do any of that we hired engineers that we thought shared our values in culture and they felt that was the right thing to do q you talk about conventions what did you do when you had no money and you only got paid for those who used your site what did you do to scale that up how did you get users to the site brian chesky so this is not about culture but i will answer it anyway the best advice i ever got was probably from paul graham paul graham said i remember he had this line it s better to have a hundred people that love you than to have a million people that just sort of like you it s literally better to have a hundred people love you and the reason why if you have one million customers one million users and they just kind of don t care about you but they use your app and think you re okay to get them to care is a really hard thing i dont know how to get a million people to all of a sudden care but i do know if you get a hundred people who love you those people if they feel incredibly passionate they will go out and eacb tell a hundred people all movements that lead to companies or ideas start with just a hundred people so the reason this is so critical is he gave us another lesson which is that if all you need do is get a hundred people to love you is do things that dont scale so it s hard if you ve got a million people you can t you meet them all you can meet a hundred people you can spend time with them so that s exactly what we did joe nate and i would go door to door in new york city or in denver where the democratic national convention was literally staying and living with our users it s a joke that when you buy an iphone steve jobs does not come sleep on your couch but i will that was really critical living with our users all we had to do was get in with them and share a passion with our users you work backwards from a hundred people even one person but with our new technology imagine what would be an amazing experience for just this one person walk through the journey from that one person make it perfect for that one person once you make it perfect for one person it s actually really easy to make a service easy for one person its not that hard where everyone gets in trouble is they try to solve both at the same time so the first thing we did was went door to door that is one thing that set up memories i will give one more example before i stop talking about this right now with airbnb you can click a button and put in your home and a professional photographer comes to your home and photographs it for free we have five thousand photographers around the world and we have photographed hundreds of thousands of homes so it is the probably one of the largest on demand photography groups around i believe this started with joe and i we were staying with this one host in new york city and her house is amazing but her photos were terrible so we asked why you dont put up better photos this is before the life of the great cameras 2008 she couldnt figure out how to get photos from her phone onto her computer she wasnt a very technically savvy woman and i just said we will just take photos for you actually i said what if you could press a button and somebody would show up at your door to take professional photographs she said that would be magic so the next day i knock on her door going im here i photographed her home i sent a few emails to people saying we give this new magical photography service and if you want you can press the button for a professional photographer to show up at your home so they would hit this button and it would send me this alert we rented a camera in brooklyn and in january 2009 walking through the snow we photographed peoples homes we did this by hand without any technology we managed that with spreadsheets i wasnt going to bother nate to design something for photography then we started hiring contract photographers eventfully we got an intern to manage all the contract photographers then we made a full time position to manage the other interns of the contract employees and at some point this is before we built anything at some point there were too many people to manage there were like hundreds of photographers then we built all the tools to do all the photography but we did it only after we knew what the perfect service was q one more question the question is in this particular situation with airbnb a lot of people think it is not necessarily a technology company but more of a marketing company brian chesky good question i will answer the question with a story alfred lin let me preface that question with a series of questions do you today have propriety technology brian chesky yes alfred lin do you have a moat brian chesky yes alfred lin do you have network effects brian chesky yes alfred lin do you have pricing power brian chesky yes alfred lin do you have a good brand brian chesky i think so alfred lin are you a monopoly brian chesky i am not going to answer that one alfred lin getting back to the question just forgetting about all of that companies that have network effects and sort of get off the ground the fly wheel is going people just think you are lucky brian chesky let me just answer that one its a totally fair question and people have said it so i want to answer it the guy who owns sequoia capital his name is doug leone one day i think it was a year year and half ago he says your job sucks and i was all what the hell does that mean he says you have the worst job of any ceo in my portfolio i said tell me why and this is what he said first of all you are a technology company and i would say that at our heart we are a technology company so you have all the challenges of all the other portfolio companies but beyond that you are in a hundred and ninety different countries so you have to figure out how to be international you have to hire in every country in the world we are literally in every country except north korea iran syria and cuba we are a payments company we handle billions of dollars of transactions a year we had to get a business license in the state of california we have serious fraud and risk it needs to be locked down like fort knox he said thats usually where companies end but you have to worry about all the other crap trust and safety we have four hundred and twenty five thousand people staying in other people s individual beds in their sheets think about a woman from texas staying in the middle east or vice versa think about the cultural conflicts that could happen and misunderstandings you have four hundred and twenty five thousand people a night its like being the mayor of oakland so imagine you are the mayor of oakland and all the things that happened in oakland tonight you have trust and safety now we have regulatory problems we are in thirty thousand different cities every city has different rules different laws and many were written in a different century they were written before you had all the technology then you have issues like search and discovery google has this thing about being really good at search google can give me all these results but its clear that there is only one or two right answers for everybody we have forty thousand homes in paris there is no best home in paris for anyone in this room so we have to be really really great at matching people and technology another example facebook is a digital product their product is their website our product is these experiences that you have in the real world we are not just an online product but also an offline product so basically the long and the short of it is we have to be world class at technology world class at design we have to be world class at branding we have to convince government we are good for their neighborhood because we have to convince people that we are not crazy this is a real thing we have to make sure trust and safety is world class we handle all these payments and handle risk and i didnt even mention culture this was not about culture i really do not see it as a marketing company alfred lin thank you brian chesky thank you guys 5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics are a transcript of a lecture discussing company culture,

I can’t stop wondering what the northern lights look like in person.,if i could take a look through picture frames and books i wonder what it is i d see cities lights and sunsets faces i dont know yet think of what the time can bring run like rivers chasing dreams i kiss you in the city streets see young hwart with a brand new point of view when we grow old well turn the pages take a look back down through the ages it was bright all this life i lived with you if i could take a look through picture frames and books i wonder what it is i d see,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of wonder and curiosity, which aligns somewhat with the user's emotional state of wondering about the northern lights.

Overall, the song does not effectively match the emotional tone or context of the user's experience."

The song instead discusses a scenario involving a romantic anticipation and a rule of 'no boys til midnight,' which does not relate to the fear or tension described in the prompt. The repetition of the phrase 'no boys til midnight' does not provide much lyrical depth or narrative coherence, although the lyrics are somewhat fluent. Overall, the song does not effectively match the emotional intensity or the specific context of the user's experience."

The lyrics appear to be in a different language and are not coherent or understandable without translation, making it impossible to assess any emotional or contextual relevance to the user's situation. Additionally, the lyrics do not seem to reflect the warmth and comfort conveyed in the user's prompt, nor do they relate to the specific scenario of coming home to a comforting surprise. Therefore, the song does not match the user's emotional and contextual needs."
"Every corner of the house still echoes dad’s jokes, and he’s not here anymore.",the buzzing of the house has disappeared the glow is dimmed and contact s lost voices faces who were here the corner of the room was on and nothing else was needed no one else required nothing happens now it s all gone quiet for all intents for all our trust what was ever true the daily grind it sprang to life watching what was on instead of watching out the hours and hours and time to change i realise i m one of all the same but when i see you soon remind me how you lit up every room you knew that you were needed you talked and never tired how does it feel now that you ve been retired ,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song captures the emotional essence of missing a vibrant presence that once filled the house, aligning well with the user's sentiment of missing their dad's jokes. The lyrics reflect on the quiet that follows the absence of a once lively figure, which is contextually relevant to the user's experience of loss. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat fragmented, making it slightly challenging to follow a clear narrative or emotional progression, which slightly detracts from the overall impact."

The lyrics describe a mischievous and confrontational scenario on a Facebook study group, which is unrelated to the user's context of academic success and celebration. The lyrics are somewhat coherent as a narrative but are filled with slang, abrupt changes, and a casual tone that does not match the significance and positivity of the user's situation. Overall, the song fails to reflect the user's emotions and context, and the lyrics do not provide a coherent or appropriate response to the user's prompt."

However, the emotional alignment is low (scored at 1) because the song does not capture the specific anxiety or nervousness of waiting outside an exam hall; instead, it focuses on pride and success in the music industry. The lyrical coherence is also low (scored at 1), as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, which might not effectively communicate a clear or relatable message to someone in the user's situation."
The sky finally cleared after days of rain—feels like good things are coming.,you came like the sun shining down weather was good we re just fine somewhere to rest my tired legs hope you can wait for things to change it s about this side of mine of mine i am not that far behind behind,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of optimism and change, aligning well with the user's emotion of feeling hopeful as the sky clears. This earns a high score in emotional alignment. Contextually, the mention of good weather and change resonates with the clearing sky and anticipation of good things, making it somewhat relevant. However, the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack fluency, which affects the lyrical coherence score, as it can be challenging to follow the narrative or thematic continuity in the song."
Saw my app featured on the store’s front page—cheeks hurt from smiling.,i stopped off at the grocery store to pick up a few things and i was reaching for some cheerios when i heard someone say my name i knew exactly who it was my heart started to race i turned around my legs got weak when i saw her face there stood the girl that broke my heart just a year ago i thought that i was over her but little did i know that running into her like that would leave me in a total mess wishing that we never said goodbye and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she ran over and hugged my neck i didn t want her to let go she smiled and said i looked just like a kid with my box of cheerios we laughed and talked about old times which wasn t all that smart cause it just left me with an emptiness when she pushed away her cart and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she walked away looked back and smiled clean up on aisle five,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of joy and pride from seeing their app featured. The song's narrative focuses on a melancholic encounter with a past love in a grocery store, which contrasts sharply with the user's celebratory mood. Contextually, the song's setting and theme of a sorrowful reunion are irrelevant to the user's situation of a professional achievement. The lyrics themselves are coherent and tell a clear story, hence a moderate score on lyrical coherence. Overall, the song is not a suitable match for the user's current emotional and contextual state."

However, the song primarily focuses on romantic and existential themes rather than a humorous or trivial realization, leading to a lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are poetically coherent and well-constructed, earning a higher score in lyrical coherence. Overall, while there's a slight emotional connection in terms of realization, the context and theme of the song do not strongly match the user's situation."
The vet said the tests are normal—I can finally breathe again.,my toes can talk and they re smiling at me come down they say not afraid anymore and they talk to me and they smile at me i walked upstream and i sat in the mud life starts again watching trees decompose and they talk to me and they smile at me 1,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,"The recommended song captures a sense of relief and rejuvenation, aligning well with the user's emotional state of finally being able to 'breathe again' after receiving good news from the vet. This is reflected in the lyrics where elements like 'smiling' and 'not afraid anymore' resonate with feelings of relief and happiness. However, the context of the song, which seems to involve a more nature-focused and introspective scenario, does not directly relate to the user's situation concerning pet health. The lyrical coherence is somewhat low, as the lyrics are a bit disjointed and abstract, making it harder to grasp a clear narrative or fluent message. Overall, the song partially fits the emotional and contextual needs of the user but could be improved in terms of direct relevance and clarity."
"I laughed at his idea during the meeting, and guilt’s eating at me now.",i m sorry that joke flew right over your head that time it s not my fault it wasn t mine it s not my fault i couldn t tell if you were gonna laugh or cry at least when you were here i had someone to blame i had someone now it s not that easy and it s not the same well i m filing all the changes down i can turn the pages now i think i m doing okay by myself it just seems a little lonely now just a little while longer now to make myself understand how at least when you were here i had someone to blame i had someone now it s not that easy and it s not the same,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.67,"The song lyrics partially align with the user's emotional state of guilt, particularly in the repeated expression of regret and the difficulty of facing situations alone. However, the song seems to focus more on the aftermath of losing someone rather than the specific act of laughing at someone's idea, which slightly misaligns with the user's context of feeling guilty about a specific incident in a meeting. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, with a clear expression of regret and loneliness, but they can be repetitive and slightly ambiguous, which affects their overall clarity and impact in directly addressing the user's feelings of guilt."
The empty seat at our usual café table made the coffee taste bitter today.,a city full of people and my favorite is that waitress and she treats me like some type of common vagrant i see her every day but there s nothing to say unless i decide to step inside of that cafe i only get to sit if i buy something to eat otherwise it s best to keep my feet moving down that street and god damn she s a hard bitch talks at me like i m the bad dog that got into the garbage yeah i know that the toilet is for customers you ain t got to tangle up the strings to make this puppet work it doesn t have to be a game of patty cake but it ain t like you don t know i sleep in that alleyway and by the way i can see it in your eyes you re angry with your life not a stranger to the fight i bet you hate every man that you date and you re probably addicted to all types of escape you take it out on me that you re all alone when you know you got your own closet full of hollow bones watch the tone when you speak to old folks i m grown just trying to get out of this minnesota cold look lady i m homeless i m crazy i m so hopeless i m suicidal daily if you and i can t co exist let s fake it cause i ain t got the energy it takes for this relationship i m waiting for a city bus to flatten me and transport me to the ever after happily maybe reincarnated with luck come back to earth as a cockroach in your tip cup she said she s had it up to here she s gonna call authorities if i don t disappear i love her threats it rejuvenates my breath i give her stress for the reaction that it gets i got a pocket full of panhandled money on a cup of bad coffee and a stale honey bun in front of everyone she calls me bum but she notices my absence on them afternoons i don t come so here i am thorn in her hip holding down the corner table all morning with some corn chips ignoring the insults and evil eyes i feed off of em i wonder when she ll realize that she s the only reason i visit the only woman in my world that acknowledges my existence and if my ship ever comes i ll miss it because i m getting old and i ain t got much left to give it so there it is and i have to live with it i had the chance to make a difference but i didn t in the cafe bathroom drinking free tap water thinking damn i should ve been a better father to my daughter 7,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,"The recommended song lyrics depict a complex relationship between a homeless man and a waitress, focusing on themes of neglect, societal judgment, and personal regret. Emotional alignment scores low as the song's primary emotions of resentment and despair contrast sharply with the user's prompt of sadness and nostalgia due to an absent friend. Contextually, the song does involve a café setting, which aligns partially with the user's prompt, but the nature of the interactions and the background of the characters diverge significantly from the user's scenario. Lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are clear and tell a consistent story, though the narrative is complex and might be challenging to follow without careful attention. Overall, the song does not effectively match the emotional or situational context described by the user."
Walked into the living room and everyone yelled “welcome back!”—did not see that coming.,i didn t know you were there until you said hello you had been watching me for i don t know how long i hit my head against the lamp as by surprise i stood up don t be afraid you said it s only me the door wasn t locked the voice i d heard in the hall was hard to recognize but now we know he s on board wearing our disguise if only you and i could trust each other through this then together we could work out who the enemy is,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The emotional alignment of the song with the prompt is moderate, as the song captures a sense of surprise and unexpectedness, similar to the user's experience of being unexpectedly welcomed. However, the song introduces elements of suspicion and mistrust which do not align with the presumably positive surprise in the prompt. Contextually, the song is not very relevant as it delves into themes of espionage and disguise, which are unrelated to the simple scenario of being welcomed back. The lyrics are somewhat coherent with a clear narrative about unexpected encounters and hidden identities, but they may be confusing without more context about the 'enemy' and the 'disguise'. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."
Seeing my younger cousin nail her first piano solo blew me away.,i m overwhelmed she stopped in for a spell i found her true like she had always knew she visits me on sunday afternoon a firmament i welcome to this room sister dressed in mourning hue fall to me sent of better rooms leave me in water colored plumes and melodies traces of the girl that i once knew in evening now she shadowed in the grey her covenant to slowly slip away,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song captures a strong emotional resonance, particularly in its portrayal of being overwhelmed and the deep, reflective mood that aligns well with the awe and emotional impact described in the user's prompt. However, the song's context diverges as it seems to focus more on a somber, reflective remembrance of a past relationship or presence, rather than the celebratory and triumphant moment of a young cousin's piano performance. The lyrics, while poetic and evocative, can be somewhat cryptic and disjointed, making them less directly coherent but still beautifully expressive in a broader sense."
My cat tried to pounce on its own shadow and face-planted into the rug; still chuckling.,once i laughed when i heard your saying that i d be playing solitaire uneasy in my easy chair it never entered my mind once you told me i was mistaken that i d awaken with the sun and ordered orange juice for one it never entered my mind you have what i laughed myself now i even have to scratch my back myself once you warned me that if you scorned me i d singing the maiden s prayer again and wish that you were there again to get into my hair again it never entered my mind it never entered my mind,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics primarily discuss feelings of loss and loneliness, which does not align well with the light-hearted, amusing scenario described in the user's prompt about a cat's playful mishap. The emotional alignment is low because the song's tone of melancholy and reflection contrasts sharply with the user's amusement. Contextually, the song also scores low as it does not relate to pets, playful incidents, or lighthearted themes. The lyrics themselves, while somewhat poetic, are disjointed and difficult to follow, leading to a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
The airline lost my bag for the third time this year and acted like it wasn't a big deal.,so many took me for granted double crossed me for the bag when it landed i m thinkin you not the only fucking plug on this planet i m patient unfamiliar aircraft in sight,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.5,"The song's mention of 'unfamiliar aircraft' and issues related to 'the bag when it landed' somewhat aligns with the context of airline baggage issues. However, the emotional tone of the song, which seems to express betrayal and frustration, does not closely match the specific frustration and resignation implied by the user's experience of repeated negligence by the airline. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but may be confusing as they jump between themes of betrayal, business dealings, and aircraft, which dilutes the focus on the user's specific issue with lost luggage. Overall, the song does not effectively capture the user's emotional state or the specific context of repeated airline baggage mishandling."
The kitchen tap drips every three seconds—can’t focus on anything else.,10 15 on a saturday night and the tap drips under the strip light and i m sitting in the kitchen sink and the tap drips drip drip drip waiting for the telephone to ring and i m wondering where she s been and i m crying for yesterday and the tap drips drip drip drip it s always the same,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,"The recommended song lyrics align well with the user's emotional state of distraction and annoyance caused by the dripping tap. The song captures the repetitive, intrusive nature of the dripping sound, which is central to the user's prompt. The context of the song, focusing on a scene in the kitchen with a dripping tap, matches perfectly with the user's situation. The lyrics are coherent and maintain a clear narrative, though the transition from the dripping tap to waiting for a phone call might slightly divert from the user's current emotional focus. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's described scenario and emotional state."
My roommate finally started rinsing the dishes instead of piling them up—honestly proud of that progress.,i feel so wholesome i could cry i got a chicken in my bandolier i ve hung it up to see if it would fall out i ve waited ages but now i m told these things take time him work here all day him got his tonsils sprayed him got no time for utensils or words to that effect i m deliberately diverging not the same but different you see i ve hung up to dry my legs hanging out someone said to sew up the bottoms but i can t reach and a fall would break my nose but still there s no harm in trying,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The recommended song lyrics do not align well with the user's prompt. The emotional alignment is low as the song's tone and content do not reflect the feeling of pride or progress in a domestic setting, but rather present a disjointed and somewhat absurd narrative. Contextually, the song fails to relate to the theme of household chores or roommate dynamics, focusing instead on bizarre and unrelated imagery. The lyrical coherence is also low, as the lyrics are confusing and lack a clear narrative or logical progression, making it difficult to discern a coherent message or theme."
Spent half the night checking on my pup’s fever; I’m dead tired but can’t leave his side.,you know i m tired i got a fevered brow you know i d change if i were with her now you gave me drugs you said d cure my ills they may cure yours but mine are with me still if i were with her now if i were with her now if i were with her now,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's mention of 'tired' and 'fevered brow' aligns well with the user's emotional state of exhaustion and concern due to their pup's fever, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on themes of illness and seeking relief, which is somewhat relevant to the user's situation of caring for a sick pet, though the song's focus on human relationships and personal change dilutes the direct relevance to the user's context with their dog. The lyrics, while somewhat repetitive and abstract, maintain a basic coherence but may be confusing due to their repetitive structure and lack of clear narrative, leading to a lower score in lyrical coherence."
The app keeps saying ‘unknown error’ and I have no clue what’s actually wrong; my brain’s spinning.,there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake i waited in the rain for hours and you were late now it s not like me to say the right thing but you could ve called to let me know i checked your number twice don t understand it so i went home well i d been waiting for this weekend i thought that maybe we could see a show never dreamed i d have this feeling oh but seeing you is believing that s why i don t know why you didn t show up that night oh there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake i was waiting in the rain for hours and you were late since then i ve been running around trying to find you i went to the places that we always go i rang your home but got no answer so i jumped in my car i went round again i still don t believe it he was just leaving oh there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake yeah oh there must be oh there must be oh oh misunderstanding oh there must be there must be oh oh misunderstanding oh there must be there must be oh oh misunderstanding oh there must be there must be oh oh misunderstanding,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song 'Misunderstanding' by Genesis captures the frustration and confusion expressed in the user's prompt about an 'unknown error' and their brain 'spinning'. The lyrics reflect a scenario of waiting and not understanding why things aren't going as expected, which aligns well emotionally with the user's feelings of confusion and frustration (scored 4). Contextually, the song deals with a personal misunderstanding and waiting, which is somewhat relevant to the user's experience with a malfunctioning app, though not directly about technological issues (scored 3). The lyrics are clear and tell a coherent story of disappointment and confusion, which makes them easy to follow and understand (scored 4). The overall effectiveness of the song in addressing the user's emotional state and context is fairly high, though slightly reduced by the specific nature of the misunderstanding being about a personal relationship rather than a technical issue."
Saw a clip of glowing plankton beaches and now I’m itching to know everything about them.,i want to be on an island off the coast of mexico there s an island with tropical sand and boats and humans who light the nighttime sky with fire i wanna colour the sky take a dream with an ember that s dancing itself away from our circle on the beach while we watch bioluminescence make shapes inside the liquid living ocean i wanna swim inside the gulf of mexico1,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,"The song captures the sense of wonder and curiosity about natural phenomena, aligning well with the user's emotional state after watching the glowing plankton. The contextual relevance is high as the lyrics specifically mention bioluminescence and describe a scene that closely mirrors the user's experience. The lyrical coherence is moderate; while the lyrics are evocative and thematic, they are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear, flowing narrative structure."
All morning I’ve been day-dreaming about escaping to a quiet cabin in the woods—can almost smell the pine.,in the hour before the devil finds i ve died i ll move slow as my ending descends from the pines because i couldn t stop for death she kindly stopped for me and she stole my breath if i m bound or gagged if i m lost or loosin i might want to leave from here until then i ll still be cruisin high above the atmosphere well i walked through that hour in a drawn out sleepless bliss blinking possibilites shuttered and ceased to exist like a prisoner of my personality my time had come and my body was set free i went easy from my body but harder from my ways i lived tall in this life but i was naked at the end of my born days when desperation rang long through me horses whispered in the distance and my body was set free,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.3,"The song lyrics have a somber and introspective tone, which partially aligns with the user's emotional state of day-dreaming and desiring escape. However, the song's focus on death and existential reflection diverges significantly from the lighter, more peaceful escape the user imagines. Contextually, the mention of 'pines' and 'atmosphere' connects with the user's vision of a cabin in the woods, but the overall theme of the song, which leans towards a final departure or death, does not fully resonate with the user's scenario of a temporary retreat. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but can be perceived as cryptic or disjointed, focusing heavily on metaphorical and abstract expressions which might not provide the clear, soothing narrative the user might be seeking in their day-dream."
"Practised for weeks, but the open-mic night was cancelled at the last minute—total letdown.",one night only is not enough,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's lyrics 'one night only is not enough' somewhat align with the user's emotion of disappointment due to the cancellation of an anticipated event. However, the lyrics lack depth and specificity to fully capture the user's specific scenario of practicing for weeks and facing a last-minute cancellation. The contextual relevance is low as the lyrics do not specifically address the situation of preparation and cancellation. The coherence of the lyrics is moderate, as the phrase is clear but too brief to provide substantial meaning or comfort."
Can’t stand how people leave popcorn and cups all over the cinema floor after a movie; it really bothers me.,lets be clear about this guys were not gonna agree on everything okay but we should agree on this if you bring a baby into a movie theater youre a piece of shit yup if your reason for doing it is you couldnt get a babysitter well then you dont get to go to the movies thats how that works it happened to me in back to back movies which statistically i did not think was possible first movie im in there five minutes im watching the movie and i hear waaah what i turn and in the row behind me theres a mother a father and a baby not a child which i think is an important distinction its a baby im like all right these people are insane um ill just ignore this turn back 30 seconds later waah im like well now i have to say something now im polite so i turn and i go excuse me are you stabbing your baby right now cause it sounds like it and the dad goes no i love the baby you picture him okay i love him pero no its my baby and i said well could you cause im trying to watch this movie and your babys ruining it and he was like no no puedo so i get up i go to the lobby i see the manager of the theater and i go hey theres a fucking baby in there being a baby right now and the manager goes some people suck and he walked away that is the best customer service line ive ever heard in my life hands down you cant even get mad if youre in a restaurant been waiting on your food like where the fuck is my food ive been here half an hour and the managers like some people suck you d be like oh yeah some people suck i didnt think about it my bad sorry about that i left i left the next day i go back to the movies i should point out i saw a different movie it was also a different baby its not the same family standing out front and then they see me and theyre like oh there he is lets go inside and ruin this for him again this time i am way further into the movie im emotionally invested in this movie i like the movie and then out of nowhere i hear waah this time i swear to you i audibly go nuh uh and now other people get involved you know when you can hear somebodys age in their voice like i cant see shit its a dark theater i just hear a guy go either make it quiet or get it out that guys 140 years old like i could hear that hed never hugged his children i could hear it in his voice this time the mother of the baby goes shut up and i was like oh shit like we have a situation and then a third person goes shh what are you doing shush is passive aggressive she said shut up just go straight to fuck you what are you doing but now i wanted to be the hero and like save the movie i felt a tremendous sense of injustice like all these movies are being ruined by babies but i didnt realize i was too angry in that moment to um what is it speak english words in a sentence you know when you get real rage like like just dude like like you feel it your throat dries out and aah so i stood up in the theater with the best intentions and i went why is everybody not in the adult movie like none of it made sense everybodys like whos that fucking guy whats his problem i was i was trying to say lets be civilized adults but instead i went adult movie porns on now cover your babys eyes the next thing i see a white t shirt pop up and im like well theres the dad some of you got it and he looked around like whos talking shit and i was like im talking shit bitch i didnt say it but he knew what was up but then i went out the exit immediately cause im not getting my ass kicked over the lego movie so i left ,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.67,"The song's emotional alignment with the user's frustration about cinema etiquette is somewhat present, as it also deals with inappropriate behavior in a movie theater. However, the specific annoyance in the song is about babies in theaters, not littering, which leads to a low score in contextual relevance. The lyrics, while humorous and detailed, are somewhat rambling and incoherent at times, which affects the lyrical coherence score. Overall, the song captures a general frustration with movie theater etiquette but misses the specific issue of littering and is not very coherent."
Stepped into the elevator and the stench of stale sweat hit me so hard it made my stomach flip.,i was running late for work so i didn t change my shirt the evening s drinks left a lingering taste in my mouth and when i left you were fast asleep tangled in the sheets and on the bus i could have sworn it was all a dream and it didn t happen to me and then i felt the scrapes from the slippery subway grate oh how you laughed at my complete lack of grace but i could not recall a more perfect fall cause when i looked up into your eyes it didn t hurt at all and i thought be still my heart this could be a brand new start with you and it will be clear if i wake up and you re still here with me in the morning and i thought be still my heart this could be a brand new start with you and it will be clear if i wake up and you re still here with me in the morning,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.67,"The song's lyrics do not align well with the user's prompt about the unpleasant experience of a stench in an elevator. The emotional tone of the song is more reflective and romantic, focusing on a personal relationship and memories, which does not match the discomfort and negative sensory experience described in the prompt. Contextually, the song does not mention or relate to the specific scenario of being in an elevator or encountering a bad smell. However, the lyrics themselves are coherent and tell a clear story about a personal experience and emotions, which is why the coherence score is higher."
I called the new boss ‘mom’ during the video call and wanted to crawl under my desk.,the room was covered in grass the sheets were oceans as cold as ice i used to make faces at the faces you would make when i told you to look when you weren t there i sat alone inside the office where you used to hang around but i was safe inside the sound of what was lost and where i found it in the room behind the clock when i moved to dust behind it the room has shifted in this place that you call home without me in it the room was shifting in the place that you call home without me in it the room was shifting in the place that you call home without me in it and you ve been shifting in the place that you call home without me in it,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of embarrassment and desire to hide, as it primarily discusses themes of loneliness and separation. The context of the song, which seems to focus on a personal reflection and a sense of abandonment, does not match the user's situation of a workplace mishap. The lyrics are somewhat abstract and repetitive, making them difficult to follow, which affects their coherence in relation to the user's prompt."

However, the song's theme of success and winning ('never takin L's i m forever winning') only marginally matches the user's specific context of excitement for a sports event. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but are cluttered with various themes and braggadocious lines that dilute the overall message, making it less relevant to the user's prompt."
Walking past that abandoned lot at night makes my pulse race.,and 6 am in morningside the first car rushes by we walk down to the garden and the sunlight fills your eyes and stops me for a moment till i turn and look the other way the windows are all open and it s saturday and where i ride the evening turns to blue and fades away a silence hangs enchanted through sunset and the lane the air is charged with sunlight and your name is ringing through my mind cathedral bells and sunlit is the night,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.5,"The recommended song lyrics primarily describe serene and peaceful morning scenes, which contrasts sharply with the user's prompt of feeling a racing pulse when walking past an abandoned lot at night. The emotional alignment is low because the song evokes a sense of calm and beauty, rather than the anxiety or fear implied in the prompt. Contextually, the song also does not match well as it talks about mornings and sunlight, which is quite the opposite of a night setting. The lyrical coherence is moderate as the lyrics are somewhat poetic and fluent, but they lack a clear narrative or strong connection between the images described."
A stranger held the door while I juggled coffee and my laptop—brightened my morning.,i looked you up and down i liked everything i saw from the fragile outline of your hips to the trembling movements in your jaw but then the coffee cup shattered on the kitchen floor you said that you couldn t take it anymore i knew you were leaving i knew you were going to bristol i watched you pack your bags saw you head up to the door but when the key broke off in the deadbolt lock you said that you couldn t take it anymore that was the second time you said that in one day why don t you just sit still it s going to be ok going to bristol going to bristol going to bristol going to bristol,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's prompt. The emotional tone of the song, which deals with a breakup and a sense of abandonment, contrasts sharply with the positive and light-hearted emotion conveyed in the prompt about a stranger's small act of kindness. Contextually, the song's focus on a personal relationship and emotional turmoil is irrelevant to the scenario of a simple, uplifting gesture in daily life. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent narrative about a relationship ending, but they do not connect with the user's experience. Overall, the song does not effectively match the emotional or contextual needs of the user's prompt."
Scrolled past an old voicemail from her and suddenly the room felt empty.,the buzzing of the house has disappeared the glow is dimmed and contact s lost voices faces who were here the corner of the room was on and nothing else was needed no one else required nothing happens now it s all gone quiet for all intents for all our trust what was ever true the daily grind it sprang to life watching what was on instead of watching out the hours and hours and time to change i realise i m one of all the same but when i see you soon remind me how you lit up every room you knew that you were needed you talked and never tired how does it feel now that you ve been retired ,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The recommended song lyrics align well emotionally with the user's prompt, capturing the sense of emptiness and loss when reminded of someone from the past. The lyrics reflect on the silence and absence left behind, which resonates with the user's feeling of an 'empty room.' Contextually, the song fits the theme of reminiscence and the impact of someone's presence, mirroring the user's experience of encountering an old voicemail. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat lower due to the somewhat disjointed and abstract nature of the lyrics, which might make it harder for some listeners to follow the narrative or emotional thread consistently."
My balcony tomatoes finally turned bright yellow today—couldn’t stop smiling.,and how i know i m happy now i jump right down the shoots of time and yes the weather was not always grey but the furrow always grazed my brow mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm now i m overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light yes we had some hard work but now it s right overcome with light overcome and my worries then were not grand but i felt them like a hammer pounding like i really feel feel them now and in a pinch i know i m dreaming mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm now i m overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light yes we had some scrapes but now it s right overcome with light overcome overcome with light overcome with light overcome,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song's repeated theme of being 'overcome with light' aligns well with the user's emotion of joy and satisfaction from seeing their tomatoes turn bright yellow, which is a visually 'light' and happy moment. This earns a high score in emotional alignment. However, the song's broader themes of overcoming past hardships and struggles do not directly relate to the simple, joyful context of gardening success, leading to a lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and abstract but maintain a certain poetic fluency, resulting in a moderate score in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song captures the emotional uplift but misses the mark on the specific, lighter context of the user's prompt."
He doodled a silly sketch of us on the fridge; totally melted my heart.,you looked liked pingu in the igloo your nose was cold you showed me the icicle that you found hanging from the roof i remember your entrance to the room i was in and the half pint glass you were holding that made you look bigger than you were you drew a charming stick man on my left hand and you told me not to wash it off we loved you we loved you,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The recommended song captures a tender and playful moment similar to the user's prompt about a doodle that melted their heart. The emotional alignment is high, as both the song and the prompt share themes of affection and cherished memories. Contextually, the song mentions drawing on the hand, which aligns somewhat with the act of doodling in the prompt, though it's not a perfect match since the contexts of the drawings differ slightly. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear, albeit whimsical, story of affection and small, meaningful gestures, which resonates well with the sentiment of the user's experience."
Waiting outside the dentist’s room; my knee won’t stop bouncing.,bad blood saturating the sheets and the blankets good god there are ghosts floating up from the pavement they flip over the houses blood runs out from the basements in its unholy flow you remember this whimpering thick nauseous feeling from your step brother chasing you around with a staple gun when you were young it was fun and then suddenly pain became a very real thing do you remember that feeling similarly this isnt fiction well actually mostly it is or a series of irl moments cloaked in the vagueness that songs give but when theres nothing to say and youve got to say something fuck i dont even know we pass on the street and say hi cause we have to even though both of us are clearly just like i fucking hate you so stilted and silent not awkward just angry hey i gotta go but ill see you at the show its that song everybody loves but the are garbage and it stresses me out how often youre mentioned its like everyone we know collectively vomited up a pile of brown sweaters or something and were so impressed with the results that they put them on the wall and im so sad youre in my head and im so sorry its so venomous especially because weve got like maybe four or five words ever spoken between us but i cant heave my heart into my mouth i cant tell you i cant stop you i dont want to this first day of school shit just seems to keep happening everybody says man its so cool were so glad youre doing your own thing but worse than disdain is colossal indifference the smiles are so big and theres no one at the gig im either deep in the woods or on tv for everyone and i know its disgusting how much i think about myself in relation to nothing the things that arent gonna stay just arent gonna stay like i was getting a tooth pulled in the free clinic in portland in 2007 the dentist turned out to be this dude a drummer whose band id recorded and somehow that was comforting then the novocaine block kicked in it closed up my throat and i was ready to go home maybe once this record comes out then i can stop drinking that might look good on a press release or something if they even still do those wait im certain they still do those and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.33,"The song lyrics are chaotic and filled with various intense emotions and scenarios, which do not align well with the simple, anxious feeling of waiting outside a dentist's room. The mention of a dentist and a tooth extraction within the lyrics provides a slight contextual relevance, but it is buried within a narrative that is largely irrelevant to the user's situation. The lyrics are disjointed and difficult to follow, lacking coherence and a clear narrative flow, which makes it hard to extract a meaningful connection to the user's prompt."

The emotional alignment scores a 3 as the song conveys a sense of perseverance and mixed feelings, similar to the user's experience. Contextually, the song scores a 2 because it primarily focuses on the struggle between professional commitments and personal life rather than directly addressing the theme of job interviews and career progression. The lyrics are quite coherent, maintaining a consistent theme throughout, which justifies a score of 4 in lyrical coherence. The overall score is 3, indicating a moderate match between the song and the user's emotional and contextual prompt."
Ran my first 5 k without stopping; pretty pleased with myself.,tried to call you n got the answer phone now i m glad i m free to spend a weekend on my own do the shopping jog in the park and there s a lot of housework that needs to be done i m turning myself into a superhero of sorts and i m so happy now you didn t take my call this morning,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song partially aligns with the user's emotion of feeling pleased with themselves, as it mentions being 'so happy' and engaging in activities like jogging, which could relate to the user's achievement of running a 5k. However, the song's main theme seems to revolve around enjoying time alone after a missed call, which diverges from the user's context of celebrating a personal fitness milestone. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack fluency, making it difficult to fully grasp a coherent narrative or emotional depth, which affects the overall relevance and impact in relation to the user's prompt."
"Realised the meeting invite said 7 a.m., not p.m.—no wonder no one joined.",not submitted,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"As no song lyrics were submitted, it is impossible to evaluate the emotional alignment, contextual relevance, or lyrical coherence in relation to the user's prompt. Therefore, all scores are zero."
The lights flicked back on as soon as the storm ended—felt like exhaling.,the sun went down and the ground started sort of grinding a blinding light tore across the sky a cyclone swept the landscape out and left it completely flattened out and several twirls of smoke unfolded like gigantic flowers the way the morning broke was quite unusual i should have wakened up at once but this was no concern of mine so i kept on dreaming my eyes roamed over the burning ruins in less time than it takes to tell and i felt like and i felt like being numbed i felt like mesmerized the way the morning broke was quite unusual more than words can say in less time than it takes to tell,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics describe a scene of destruction and chaos following a storm, which contrasts with the user's prompt that conveys a sense of relief and calm after the storm. Emotional alignment is low as the song conveys a sense of devastation rather than relief. Contextually, the song fits as it also deals with the aftermath of a storm, but the tone and aftermath are vastly different from the user's experience. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but can be perceived as disjointed and abstract, making it difficult to follow a clear narrative or emotional thread."

Boxed up the holiday decorations; the living room looks strangely empty.,christmas time is here again it don t seem so different when last year which was filled with emptiness all around directionless,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of emptiness and a lack of direction, which aligns well with the user's emotional state after removing holiday decorations, leaving the space feeling empty. The mention of 'Christmas time' directly ties to the context of packing up holiday decorations. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, though they could be more fluid and detailed to fully convey the scene and emotions."
Opened the fridge and found a note that read ‘road trip tomorrow!’—didn’t see that coming.,yesterday alone i laid everything out on the carpet books kitchen things objects with specific purpose or none arranged them sideways in a grid on the floor there unmoored out of context and then considered it first the whole picture then everything individually humming along at the deadest pace imaginable one object then another and then the next and i wondered what they meant there if they meant anything still found notes camping supplies a book you bought in the desert identifying wildflowers pictures from vacations from parties kitschy gifts we bought from rest stops on that road trip out west objects everything itself and then memory all of it laid out there from the dining room the living room the hallway and the basement and the kitchen from that room we called the office but never used even the bathroom everything laid out there on the floor on the carpet out of context and i sat there for hours today i moved everything from the floor to the table in the dining room placed each thing carefully without reason or at least without one i understood or could describe there on the table together and when i was done and stepped back i realized what i had made keepsakes pictures letters ordinary objects all collected there a memorial and i thought of ones on highways or set by gravestones all the things you see there but dont understand but still bring a remembered thing back vividly invoke someones reality when there together in that place in that way out of context and i knew i had to take it down before anybody else saw tomorrow i plan to put them all somewhere those things in boxes side of the road attic maybe all these things that push and pull me through history to places i once was places i mightve gone places i ended up going postcards ticket stubs from one thing or another a personalized coffee mug neither your name nor mine phone cards and old phones a page from an old calendar i bought once at a thrift store and insisted on hanging that cycles of the moon print photos old boots of mine put them in boxes and i sat there for hours in the living room first then in the dining room moving things around picking things up and seeing where they took me to what place in history what moment on our timeline where we were where i was where i thought wed end up in this house or on the highway driving somewhere near christmas in the desert or anywhere else and i put them in boxes6,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of unexpectedness and nostalgia, which aligns moderately with the emotional surprise and anticipation of a sudden road trip found in the user's prompt. Contextually, the lyrics delve into memories and keepsakes, which can be associated with road trips and the experiences collected along the way, making it quite relevant. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low as the lyrics are presented in a stream-of-consciousness style without clear structure, making it challenging to follow the narrative clearly. Overall, the song moderately fits the prompt, capturing the essence of unexpected journeys and the memories they hold, despite the lyrical complexity."
Watching my sister patiently guide my nephew through his first steps left me amazed by her dedication.,i m watchin sis go pitterpat said i can do that i can do that knew ev ry step right off the bat said i can do that i can do that one morning sis won t go to dance class i grab her shoes and tights and all but my foot s too small so i stuff her shoes with extra socks run seven blocks in nothin flat hell i can do that i can do that i got to class and had it made and so i stayed the rest of my life all thanks to sis i can do this that i can do i can do that ,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of admiration and inspiration, similar to the user's emotion of amazement at their sister's dedication. However, the song focuses more on the speaker's own ability to emulate and surpass, rather than on the dedication of the sister, which slightly misaligns with the user's focus on the sister's dedication. Contextually, the song involves dance and self-improvement, which doesn't directly relate to the specific scenario of guiding a child's first steps. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, lacking fluency and making it difficult to follow a coherent narrative, which affects the overall coherence score."
I just finished a comedy movie and found myself laughing out loud through the entire end credits.,i started a joke which started the whole world crying but i didn t see that the joke was on me oh no i started to cry which started the whole world laughing oh if i d only seen that the joke was on me i looked at the skies running my hands over my eyes and i fell out of bed hurting my head from things that i d said til i finally died which started the whole world living oh if i d only seen that the joke was on me i looked at the skies running my hands over my eyes and i fell out of bed hurting my head from things that i d said til i finally died which started the whole world living oh if i d only seen oh yeah that the joke was on me oh no that the joke was on me oh11,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,"The song 'I Started a Joke' by the Bee Gees, while involving themes of jokes and laughter, contrasts sharply with the user's experience of lighthearted, joyful laughter from watching a comedy movie. The song's emotional tone is melancholic and introspective, focusing on the personal repercussions of a joke gone wrong, which does not align well with the joyful, carefree emotion described in the prompt. Contextually, the mention of jokes connects loosely to the comedy movie, but the overall somber mood of the song does not fit the light-hearted context. The lyrics themselves are coherent and well-constructed, maintaining a clear narrative and emotional expression throughout."
"I just returned to my desk and found my meticulously organized files shredded and scattered everywhere, and I was absolutely furious.",all our loose ends are gathered here inside this house you left me here to sort them out but its not all yours really i kept a few to hold onto i tied them to my wrists and you said does it feel watered down does it feel over now do you feel watered down do you feel older now you hated when i said i needed anything i didn t so i walked into your room and took it all,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
The neighbor's car alarm blaring at sunrise grated on my nerves and ruined my morning.,i tried so hard to stay strong the first time i slept alone but the paint was ripped off my front door there was no one to open it though let s talk about it pull me into your darkness there s nothing left to give away nothing left to say today today but the paint got ripped off my front door the paint was ripped off my front door the paint was ripped off my front door,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics do not align well with the user's emotional state of irritation and disruption caused by a car alarm. The lyrics focus on loneliness and a sense of abandonment, which does not match the annoyance and disturbance described in the prompt. Contextually, the song also fails to connect as it discusses themes of emotional pain and isolation rather than the specific scenario of a disruptive noise early in the morning. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear progression, which affects their coherence, though they do maintain a consistent theme of emotional distress."
"After staying up all night finishing that report, hearing my manager praise my work in the morning convinced me i’d made the right call.",listen to the sound listen to the sound everything always works out,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics 'listen to the sound listen to the sound everything always works out' align well emotionally with the user's feeling of validation and relief after receiving praise from their manager. This reflects a positive and reassuring emotion, similar to the user's experience. Contextually, the lyrics are somewhat relevant as they convey a general sense of things turning out well, which matches the user's outcome of their hard work being recognized. However, the lyrics do not specifically address the scenario of working hard all night or the work environment, which limits the contextual score. The lyrical coherence is good as the lyrics are simple and clear, though they are repetitive and lack depth, which affects the overall coherence slightly."
"My brother felt terrible all night, so I stayed by his side and made sure he had everything he needed.",oh brother brother brother i know you ve been laying back a long time but i love you like no other oh brother brother brother i ve been watching everything you do and i ve been wishing only good for you all you ve got to do is just want it to and it s gonna come to you you have always been so good to me and though you didn t always talk to me there wasn t much my loving eyes could not see and i don t believe you need all your misery ,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.3,"The song's lyrics strongly resonate with the user's emotional state, expressing deep care and affection for a brother, which aligns well with the user's act of staying by their brother's side during a tough time. The lyrics emphasize love, support, and a desire for the brother's well-being, which matches the context of caring for a sibling. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express these sentiments, making it easy to understand and relate to. The song might not perfectly capture the specific scenario of feeling 'terrible all night,' focusing more broadly on support and love, hence not scoring a perfect 5."
Receiving an urgent call from my doctor asking me to come in immediately without any details left me completely uncertain about what was wrong.,the doctor came in the morning she held my hand and asked was it worth it could it be worse than this please recall give me a hint anything will do if this was the last time now you should tell us what to do i was afraid i guess now i can t think no more i was so concentrated on keeping things together i ve learned to focus on i didn t want to disappoint now where is everybody is it still light outside 1,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song lyrics reflect a high level of emotional alignment with the user's prompt, capturing the uncertainty and fear of receiving an urgent, ambiguous call from a doctor. The mention of the doctor and the emotional turmoil aligns well with the user's feelings. Contextually, the song fits as it involves a medical scenario and the emotional response to it, though it diverges slightly in detail and narrative focus. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics convey a clear emotional state and scenario but are somewhat fragmented and could be more fluid in expressing a cohesive narrative."
I just uncovered a major secret hidden in the archives and can’t stop wondering what else I’ll find.,well i was ready to walk into your heart i ll make believe there s something i ve lost but i think you know what i ve done oh i think you know i ll be your surprise it s just a secret that s alwasy on display or just a memory you can t throw away oh i ll be your surprise,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.67,"The song captures a sense of secrecy and surprise, which aligns somewhat with the emotion of uncovering a hidden secret as described in the prompt. However, the song's focus on personal relationships and emotional revelations doesn't perfectly align with the more investigative or discovery-oriented nature of the prompt. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent theme of hidden truths and surprises, but they are slightly abstract and disjointed, which might make it harder for the user to fully connect them with the specific context of uncovering historical or informational secrets in archives."

The song's theme revolves around a wild, carefree romantic encounter, which is largely unrelated to cooking or the specific culinary experience of making a chocolate soufflé. The emotional alignment is low as the song conveys a sense of wild romance and rebellion, which does not match the user's feeling of excitement and curiosity about cooking. Contextually, the song is irrelevant to the cooking or culinary theme. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but repetitive and lack a clear structure, making them difficult to follow, thus scoring low on lyrical coherence."
"I opened the email to see that tonight’s concert had been canceled, leaving me utterly let down.",i dropped my book and saw a face her hair red my feelings cold i just can t feel anything anymore funerals are for the living but i can t quite die i really want to go but i will miss music like this and i would forever wonder if everything would turn out okay in the end come on we all die in the end but at times i want to die in the middle but now now i think it s the end,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
"I just found out the community center canceled the free cooking classes without telling me, and it felt unfair that they didn’t ask for my opinion.",i went to class you didn t show up i thought we said that we d keep in touch walk through town disassembled on a crutch just like we did when you were in love i left the house and i didn t miss much you opened your mouth and i lost my trust yeah i left the house for the first time in months for the first time in months now here i am disassembled as a whole when i got home i lost control,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"The song captures a sense of disappointment and betrayal, which aligns with the user's feelings of unfairness regarding the cancellation of the cooking classes. However, the context of the song, which seems to focus more on personal relationships and emotional breakdowns, only partially matches the user's situation related to a community event. The lyrics are coherent and express a clear narrative of feeling let down and losing trust, which resonates with the user's experience of not being consulted about the cancellation."
"I just took a bite of my sandwich and realized it had gone bad, making my stomach turn.",i burnt the roof of my mouth on some pizza that was not even good i know that i should have waited for the cheese to cool down but i was hungry because i forgot to eat breakfast,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,"The recommended song lyrics describe an experience of discomfort caused by eating, similar to the user's experience with a bad sandwich. However, the emotional alignment is moderate as the song focuses on a minor burn from hot pizza, which is a different type of discomfort compared to the stomach-turning feeling from spoiled food. Contextually, the song is somewhat relevant as it deals with a negative food experience, but the specifics differ. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear, albeit simple, story about impatience and its consequences."
I just waved enthusiastically at someone who wasn’t waving at me and wanted to disappear on the spot.,last night i saw someone with your eyes someone with your smile someone with your smile we danced and though glad that she had asked me to she didnt have your arms,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song captures a sense of embarrassment and awkwardness, which aligns somewhat with the user's emotional state of wanting to disappear after a misunderstanding. However, the song's primary focus on encountering someone resembling a past acquaintance and the ensuing dance does not directly relate to the user's experience of misdirected enthusiasm. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but lack a clear narrative connection or resolution, making them only moderately effective in conveying a specific message or emotion."
I just found out my best friend is flying in for a surprise visit and I can’t stop smiling.,i got a big surprise when i saw you smile i never dreamed that it could be but now i realize since i saw you smile there s only happiness for me so bye bye blues bye bye blues bells ring birds sing sun is shining no more pining just we two smiling thru don t sigh don t cry bye bye blues blues,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The song's lyrics perfectly capture the emotion of happiness and surprise, aligning well with the user's feelings upon learning their best friend is visiting. The mention of smiles and joy reflects the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song fits the theme of a joyful reunion, although it broadly addresses happiness rather than specifically focusing on the surprise element of a friend's visit. The lyrics are coherent and flow well, with a cheerful tone that matches the user's mood, though some repetitive phrases slightly affect the lyrical fluency."
"I just got word my friend is driving here through this raging thunderstorm, and each crack of thunder sent a chill down my spine.",we are in the storm ,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics 'we are in the storm' minimally align with the emotional intensity and anxiety expressed in the user's prompt about a friend driving through a thunderstorm. The lyrics are contextually relevant as they mention a storm, which directly relates to the situation described. However, the lyrics are extremely brief and lack depth, providing little to no detail or development, which results in a low coherence score. Overall, the song does not effectively capture the emotional nuance or the seriousness of the user's concern for their friend's safety in the storm."
"I came home after a long day to find my partner had cleaned up and cooked dinner, and it made me realize how lucky I am to have them.",i done run into my baby and finally found my old blue jeans well i done ran into my baby and finally found my old blue jeans i knew they was mine by the oil and the gasoline yeah if i ever get back my blue jeans well how happy could one man be i said uh if i ever get back my blue jeans well how happy can one man be cause when i get back those blue jeans yeah you know my baby will bring em home to me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics focus on the joy of finding a pair of old blue jeans, which is a stark contrast to the emotional and contextual elements of the user's prompt about appreciating their partner's thoughtful actions. The emotional alignment is very poor as the song's subject and mood do not reflect the warmth and gratitude expressed in the prompt. Contextually, the song is also irrelevant as it discusses a personal anecdote about clothing rather than a relationship or acts of kindness. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent with a clear, though repetitive, narrative about the jeans, but they do not engage with the user's situation or feelings."
"I just found my grandmother’s favorite shawl tucked in her chair, and tears welled up as I remembered her warmth.",i walked through the door with you the air was cold but something bout it felt like home somehow and i left my scarf there at your sister s house and you ve still got it in your drawer even now oh your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze we re singing in the car getting lost upstate autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place and i can picture it after all these days and i know it s long gone and that magic s not here no more and i might be okay but i m not fine at all oh oh oh cause there we are again on that little town street you almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me wind in my hair i was there i remember it all too well photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed and your mother s telling stories bout you on the tee ball team you taught me bout your past thinking your future was me and i know it s long gone and there was nothing else i could do and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to cause there we are again in the middle of the night we re dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light down the stairs i was there i remember it all too well yeah  well maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much but maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up running scared i was there i remember it all too well and you call me up again just to break me like a promise so casually cruel in the name of being honest i m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here cause i remember it all all all too well time won t fly it s like i m paralyzed by it i d like to be my old self again but i m still trying to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now you mail back my things and i walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from that very first week cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me you can t get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah cause there we are again when i loved you so back before you lost the one real thing you ve ever known it was rare i was there i remember it all too well wind in my hair you were there you remember it all down the stairs you were there you remember it all it was rare i was there i remember it all too well146,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"The song captures a sense of nostalgia and loss, which aligns emotionally with the user's experience of remembering a loved one. However, the context of the song, which revolves around a romantic relationship and its memories, doesn't perfectly match the user's context of familial love and remembrance. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story of reminiscence and emotional attachment, though they focus more on a past romantic relationship rather than a familial bond. Overall, while the song resonates on an emotional level to some extent, its specific narrative and context diverge from the user's situation."

The emotional tone of the song is joyful and whimsical, which only slightly matches the user's happiness but is contextually irrelevant. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story, but they do not relate to the user's situation of academic achievement and excitement about a future opportunity."
"I woke up this morning to find a bouquet of flowers on my nightstand with a note that said ‘just because’, and my heart melted.",you re a long way from california the way you smile i know you re new it s not warm like arizona but damn i m glad that i met you the way you make me feel inside the way your eyes light up the night this town ain t cold with you it s loud but i can t hear a thing cause when you re close i start to think that i don t wanna wake up don t care if it s morning just put me back to sleep love cause i don t wanna wake up don t care if it s morning just put me back to sleep cause every time i close my eyes i wish the sun would never rise you know this bed was made for two just like i was made for you so i don t wanna wake up don t care if it s morning i must be dreaming cause i see you sleeping next to me woah woah 3000 miles were between us but now there s only avenues they say that home is where the heart is then my home should be with you yeah the way you make me feel inside the way your eyes light up the night this town ain t cold with you no it s loud but i can t hear a thing cause when you re close i start to think 1 2 3 that i don t wanna wake up don t care if it s morning just put me back to sleep love cause i don t wanna wake up don t care if it s morning just put me back to sleep cause every time i close my eyes i wish the sun would never rise you know this bed was made for two just like i was made for you so i don t wanna wake up don t care if it s morning i must be dreaming cause i see you sleeping next to me even if it starts to rain girl you know i ll keep you safe i ll keep the storm away oh you don t have to be afraid under these sheets so i don t wanna wake up don t care if it s morning just put me back to sleep love cause i don t wanna wake up don t care if it s morning just put me back to sleep cause every time i close my eyes i wish the sun would never rise you know this bed was made for two just like i was made for you so i don t wanna wake up don t care if it s morning just put me back to sleep love woah woah oh just put me back to sleep love woah woah i must be dreaming cause i see you sleeping next to me,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song captures a deep sense of affection and contentment, aligning well with the user's emotional state of feeling loved and cherished, as indicated by the surprise bouquet. The lyrics express a desire to remain in a blissful, dream-like state with a loved one, which mirrors the user's heartwarming morning surprise. However, the song's focus on not wanting the morning to come and the repeated desire to stay asleep slightly diverts from the immediate joy and surprise of receiving flowers, affecting its contextual relevance. The lyrics are generally coherent and fluently express the emotions of love and comfort, though they are somewhat repetitive which might affect the clarity of the narrative."
"I just sat down to record my podcast and realized I hadn’t rehearsed my opening lines, and I felt my palms grow clammy.",i woke early one day after a restless night i watched the stars burst and fill the morning sky with light in my hazy daze i noticed something on my bedroom floor it was an envelope i don t think i had seen before i opened it with caution and in it did reside a map and a note that said join me inside i had nothing to do that day outside of my head so i decided to just follow and see where it led it led me to a door grabbed the handle and used it stood before me was the physical embodiment of music i could barely believe my eyes she was a sepia goddess every contour was perfection and her demeanour was modest even armed with all this beauty she was in no way belittling i d liken her body to the opening riff from little wing her eyes burned deep with the passion of a nameless chain gang and lips smart with the vibe of son of a preacher man she told me she had evolved over time we sauntered into her room room with just a bed and some wine we talked for hours about the things she s seen and done but not boasting we passed the zinfandel raised the glass and just toasting we had a meeting of minds she breathed life in this old brain she was the milk in my kahla i was the hartman to her coltrane showed me scars she had acquired each time a genius would depart jimi hendrix on her left hand johnny cash on her heart different fingers mingus davis and her leg scarred for elvis ray charles on her eyelids jim morrison on her pelvis then she asked about me and my musical stylings all the things in life i found somewhat inspiring i paused the wine making me feel quite cocky feeling whatever i said she would take in and not mock me i said i m a wordsmith and artist i m deep like the tardis every time i aim for something i m gonna hit the target she joked gangster rap i said no but drop the g you might start to get a better description of me angster rap she said if it sticks you ll regret that the most appalling moniker since the dawn of dan le sac she was a sepia goddess yeah her demeanour was modest her hair was wild like the darkest deepest of forests many before me had fallen at her feet and died but then i made a connection and she let me inside she was a sepia goddess yeah her demeanour was modest hair was wild like the darkest deepest of forests many before me had fallen at her feet and died but then i made a connection and she let me inside i continue some of these clothes are looking old just like my jaded character who thinks like i m abroad but sometimes i act like an amateur this hat s an old classic in the first stage of dilapidation it s a fair evaluation that it s making this equation a little top heavy if you know what i mean cause there s a fine line between a classic and a has been as i finished that sentence i noticed the sadness in her eyes this moved me left my mind wondering why as we lay there she buried her head in my chest i wrapped my arms around her stroked her with the sweetest caress i wanted to find the right line that could make her sad head lift wanted a chance to breathe life back into music like redshift said she d grown sick and tired of the same shit i said if there was anything in the world i could do she should name it she said sit in public places and quietly observe all of the speeches mannerisms every action and word when something inspires me to concentrate on that thing get a pen and pad and then produce a vocal offering she said bring the lost art of conversation back i m sick to death of awkward silences and all that crap it s time to talk to one another share your thoughts and facts learn the more of it you give the more you get right back i looked her in the eyes and said i d do what i could then she held my head and kissed me but not like a lover would but then it also wasn t like a close friend or relative instead of exciting it was calming like a spiritual sedative and then we lay there until i woke in an empty room if i couldn t still smell her skin i d be inclined to assume that i d dreamt the whole thing but i knew that i hadn t and i d seen the perfect balance of beauty and talent after a moment of reflection i rose to my feet opened the door with squinted eyes and stepped back into the street i kind of staggered home and got out a pen as she d said i wrote down my inspiration and here s what it read she was a sepia goddess yeah her demeanour was modest hair was wild like the darkest deepest of forests many before me had fallen at her feet and died but that night i made a connection and she let me inside she was a sepia goddess yeah her demeanour was modest hair was wild like the darkest deepest of forests many before me had fallen

to unpreparedness for a podcast recording. The song's narrative focuses on a surreal and mystical encounter with the embodiment of music, which is far removed from the user's context of needing reassurance or focus. The lyrics, while poetic and imaginative, are complex and meandering, which may not provide the clarity or direct emotional support the user needs in this situation. The coherence of the lyrics is moderate as they maintain a consistent theme and imagery, but they are not straightforward or directly relevant to the user's immediate needs."
I just watched the sunrise break through the clouds and felt sure today would bring new opportunities.,the sky was bright with light the moon opened my eyes to love the sun breaks through the night gives meaning to our lives for now it s all we have to give,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics align well emotionally with the user's experience of watching the sunrise and feeling hopeful about new opportunities, as they mention the sun breaking through and giving meaning to our lives. Contextually, the lyrics are relevant as they describe the transition from night to day and the impact of this natural phenomenon on personal feelings, mirroring the user's description of the sunrise. However, the lyrical coherence is slightly lower as the lyrics, while poetic, are somewhat fragmented and lack a clear narrative flow, which might make them less impactful in conveying a structured message."

The user's prompt expresses a sense of pride and accomplishment, which the song does not reflect as it delves into a cynical view of corporate life and personal success. Contextually, the song does touch on themes of corporate success and professional demeanor, which aligns somewhat with the user's mention of a project showcased in a company newsletter. However, the overall tone and message diverge significantly from the user's positive experience. The lyrical coherence of the song is moderate; the lyrics are fluent but the message is convoluted with a satirical take on corporate relationships and success, making it less coherent in relation to the user's straightforward expression of accomplishment."
"I just found an old photo of my childhood home tucked away in a drawer, and it made me realize how far I’ve come.",i climbed the hill to julie s house the place i used to live i climbed the steps and tried the door and let myself in the kitchen clock i used to watch had stopped at five to five a photograph i d never seen a car came up the drive i stood outside the kitchen door and when she turned her head i said that i was back to stay she laughed at what i said she said that i d grow old believing that i was what mattered most that i d uncover real feelings as i got close i climbed the hill to julie s house the place i used to live i climbed the steps and tried the door and let myself in she said that i d grow old believing that i was what mattered most that i d uncover real feelings as i got close,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of nostalgia and revisiting the past, which aligns well with the user's emotional state triggered by finding an old photo of their childhood home. The emotional alignment is strong as both the song and the prompt deal with revisiting places tied to one's past and the introspection that follows. Contextually, the song fits as it describes returning to a former home, similar to the user's reflection on their childhood home. However, the song's lyrical coherence is slightly lower as the narrative can be a bit confusing and disjointed at times, making it harder to follow the exact storyline or emotional progression."

However, the mention of having 'one foot in the grave' and someone stealing the wallet introduces elements of negativity and misfortune, which contrasts with the user's positive news. Contextually, the song does not directly relate to receiving good health news or similar scenarios, making it only somewhat relevant. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, affecting their overall coherence and fluency."

The context of dealing with a parent's absence is directly mirrored in the song, making it highly relevant. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear narrative about coping with the loss of a father, though some abstract phrases might slightly obscure the message for some listeners. Overall, the song is a poignant and fitting choice for someone dealing with such a specific and deep loss."
"I just discovered a heartfelt letter from my childhood friend tucked inside an old book, and I was completely caught off guard.",today i got a letter from someone just a friend we knew some time ago and as i read between the lines i began to realize he didn t know i lost you a long long time ago oh i just can t make it any longer everything i do is always wrong i m living a lie and there s no need in trying to keep hanging on after all the good is gone lord i wish that i could die and there s no use in trying to keep hanging on after all the good is gone,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.

Contextually, the song touches on familial relationships and hopes for a sibling, which is somewhat relevant but diverges in tone and content from the user's aspirational and positive view, thus scoring a 2. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent narrative about concern for a brother's well-being and future, which earns a 3 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song does not strongly align with the user's feelings of admiration and aspiration, resulting in an overall score of 2."

feeling light and entertained by a concert. The song's lyrics focus heavily on the challenges and frustrations of touring, including references to bombings, physical exhaustion, and personal struggles, which starkly contrasts with the joyful and light-hearted experience described by the user. The lyrics are somewhat coherent in narrating the artist's tour experiences but are disjointed and ramble extensively, making it difficult to follow a clear narrative or theme. Overall, the song does not match the emotional or contextual needs of the user's prompt."
I’m honestly so mad right now. I trusted someone again and they hurt me—how can people keep doing this?,there are people who i trust there are people who trust me and i don t know why they re choosing to confide in someone who will talk about anything there are people who i miss there are people who miss me and i don t know why they re investing all their time into someone with my history so now i m numb and it s because of everything my eyes are tired my body s tired of waking up and still being me,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics chosen reflect a strong emotional alignment with the user's feelings of betrayal and disappointment, scoring a 4. The lyrics express a sense of mistrust and weariness which resonates with the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song scores a 3 as it touches on themes of trust and personal history, which are relevant to the user's situation of being hurt by someone they trusted. However, it doesn't directly address the act of betrayal, which could have made it more contextually relevant. The lyrical coherence is quite good, scoring a 4, as the lyrics are clear and convey a consistent theme of emotional exhaustion and questioning of personal relationships. Overall, the song is quite suitable for the user's emotional and contextual needs, though a more direct address of betrayal could enhance its relevance."
"There’s this person I deal with regularly, and the way he speaks just really irritates me. I don’t know why it gets to me so much.",i m bothered by the way you try to walk away when i need to talk to you it s not what you say it s what you do just like you don t even care it s all those little things whoa that get to me won t let them get to me whoa get to me right now we ve got to stop and little simple talk judging by my evil face is our friendship that meaningless to you i m not asking you to stay ,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song reflects the user's frustration with how someone communicates, aligning well with the emotional aspect of irritation and annoyance. The lyrics express a sense of being bothered by another's actions and a desire to communicate more effectively, which is relevant to the user's situation of dealing with an irritating person. However, the song's context of potentially ending a friendship might not perfectly align with the user's scenario if their relationship with the person is not a friendship. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but could be clearer and more structured to enhance understanding. Overall, the song captures the essence of the user's feelings but could be more contextually precise and lyrically fluent."
Someone at work has been handling things incredibly well. I just wanted to say I genuinely respect how he manages everything.,he is a mighty good god for him there s nothing to hard there is no problem he can t solve he is the lord of all in him i find no fault in him there is no failure in him i will not lack he is the lord of all in you i find no fault in you there is no failure in you i will not lack you are the lord of all you are the lord of all yes you are yes you are you are the lord of all ,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics focus heavily on religious praise and the omnipotence of God, which does not align well with the user's prompt about respecting a colleague's management skills at work. The emotional alignment is low because the song conveys a sense of worship and reverence, which is different from the respect and admiration described in the prompt. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it addresses spiritual themes rather than workplace dynamics or personal achievement. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but repetitive and lack a clear narrative or detailed expression that could connect more directly to the user's feelings or situation."
"I’ve been taking care of a little bunny for a couple of years, and I feel so responsible for his well-being. He means a lot to me.",you know that i care what happens to you and i know that you care for me so i don t feel alone or the weight of the stone now that i ve found somewhere safe to bury my bone and any fool knows a dog needs a home a shelter from pigs on the wing,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of care and responsibility, aligning well with the user's emotional state regarding their attachment and duty towards their bunny. However, the song's reference to a 'dog' and 'pigs on the wing' diverges from the specific context of caring for a bunny, thus receiving a lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, presenting a clear sentiment of needing a safe place and companionship, but the metaphorical language might obscure the direct relevance to the user's situation with their pet bunny."
I just got here and I feel completely disoriented. I don’t understand what’s going on or what I’m supposed to be doing.,i don t know who you think you are i don t know what you re doing here i don t know what s going on here i don t know how it s supposed to be i i don t have the vaguest notion whose it is what it s all for i don t know i m not crying laughin mostly as you can see,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics strongly resonate with the user's feeling of disorientation and confusion, as reflected in the repeated phrases 'I don't know' and expressions of uncertainty about the situation and expectations. This aligns well emotionally, scoring a 4. Contextually, the song fits the theme of being lost or out of place, scoring a 3, as it captures the essence of not understanding one's surroundings or purpose. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat lower, scoring a 2, due to the somewhat disjointed and repetitive nature of the lyrics, which might reflect the confusion but also makes it harder to derive a clear narrative or message from the song."
Lately I’ve had this urge to dive into new topics and ideas—I just feel intrigued about everything around me.,i dont think i can remember in my entire life another time just like this never did it before never been so unsure this is a special moment i dont know what to do whenever something is new i always seem to forget i cant make sense of the way the words that i want to say and lose them all in my head ready or not but here i come lured me right out of where im from i ll look around and wait to see whatever works its way to be i dont think that i could ever be prepared to discover something perfectly new but the desire to know makes it curious so i guess im kind of amused and its just the thought that maybe understanding so vaguely is the way it should be if its a mystery still and always has that appeal perhaps thats better really ready or not but here i come lured me right out of where im from i ll look around and wait to see whatever works its way to be i dont think i can remember in my entire life another time just like this dont understand what i feel cant pick out if it is real this is a special moment,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics align well with the user's emotional state of feeling intrigued and eager to explore new topics, as reflected in lines like 'never been so unsure' and 'the desire to know makes it curious.' The context of exploring new experiences or feelings is also well captured, making the song contextually relevant. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat lower due to a slightly repetitive and ambiguous structure, which might make it harder for the listener to follow a clear narrative or message. Overall, the song matches the user's prompt fairly well but could benefit from clearer and more impactful lyrics."
"More than anything right now, I just want to grow and improve. I want to become someone I can be proud of.",we can pretend who we can be a dancer in a top hat or a captain of the sea i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song's lyrics resonate well with the user's emotional desire to grow and improve, particularly emphasizing the aspect of self-acceptance and being proud of one's true self, which aligns with the user's wish to become someone they can be proud of. This earns a high score in emotional alignment. Contextually, the lyrics touch on self-expression and authenticity, which are relevant to personal growth, though they do not directly address the broader journey of self-improvement and development, leading to a moderate score. The lyrical coherence is average; the repetition of phrases adds emphasis but also limits the depth and variety of the message, making the lyrics somewhat simplistic but still clear and understandable."
"I thought I could rely on someone close to me, but they let me down again. It hurts more than I expected.",when she sat me down just to tell me i m alone again the only thing i thought was that i don t need any friends cause they re all living in my head and things will never be the same but i don t think i d have it any other way and my thoughts haven t really changed the only thing i can t figure out is who s to blame for all my selfish deeds undone i guess that i m the only one who knows that in the end i didn t try hard enough i can t wait to die alone,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of betrayal and loneliness, aligning well with the user's emotional state of feeling let down by someone close. The mention of being alone and the introspection about personal faults and the impact of others' actions on one's life resonate with the user's situation. However, the song's focus on self-blame and the extreme expression of wanting to 'die alone' might not perfectly match the user's context if they are primarily focused on the hurt from others rather than self-reflection. The lyrics are coherent and express a clear narrative of personal disappointment and introspection, though they could potentially intensify feelings of despair rather than providing comfort or a sense of understanding."
"I tried to accept things the way they are, but I can’t anymore. I don’t agree with what’s happening, and I think I need to walk away.",i cant see through this transparency but i guess ive been wrong about everything so should i lie or dumb myself down to feel okay or do i phone it in awhile until the feeling goes away im on the outside looking in and i dont see you again you know exactly where ive been becoming self aware becoming self aware im thinking i half believe that i dont care anymore walking like an old man but feeling immature weve learned we wont agree on anything the line drawn in the sand rethinking where im standing now and if ill ever stand a chance i know i know i could call this home but i dont want to make this awkward i wont i know i could call this home but i dont want to make this awkward anymore,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of disillusionment and internal conflict, aligning well with the user's feelings of inability to accept things as they are and considering walking away. This scores high in emotional alignment. The context of the song, dealing with self-awareness and the decision to potentially leave a situation, matches the user's context of needing to walk away due to disagreement, scoring well in contextual relevance. The lyrics, however, are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, which affects their overall coherence, though they still convey the intended message effectively."

I told someone I liked them and their friends laughed at me. Now I can’t stop feeling ashamed.,you came around with your eyes dancing down and we never even talked that much embarrassingly enough i asked your friends where the hell you been well they really shut me down but i didn t stop looking around let me be right there let me in let me be right there1,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a situation where the speaker feels embarrassed after an interaction involving the person they are interested in and their friends, which aligns well with the user's feelings of shame and embarrassment. This scores high in emotional alignment. The context of the song, involving social dynamics and a sense of rejection, is somewhat relevant to the user's experience of confessing feelings and facing laughter, thus the moderate score in contextual relevance. However, the lyrical coherence is lower as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative flow, making it harder to fully grasp the story or the emotions conveyed."
My new air fryer arrives in only a week! I want to use it right now!,boy i got my fire satisfy my desire i know you want it too right now right now boy i go on fire make me hotter than air i know you re feeling it too right now,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state or context. The user's prompt expresses excitement and anticipation about receiving a new air fryer, which is a specific and non-romantic context. The song lyrics, however, seem to focus on romantic and physical desire, which does not match the user's situation. The emotional alignment is low because the song's theme of desire does not reflect the user's excitement about a kitchen appliance. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it does not address or relate to cooking or kitchen appliances. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but repetitive and simplistic, leading to a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
"I had a terrifying moment recently—my whole body froze, and I felt like something horrible was about to happen.",i haven t felt this way in a long time and it scares me what are these voices that tell me that i m ugly and fake and i think they might be right i m nothing and i have no heart it s quite possibly i have no soul drugs can t help me anymore and i think i m dying we re both dying really but sooner than others i think my time is now and i burned the bodies to the ground i saw faces turned to ash and i remember these faces baby because it s the last thing you ll ever see too bad it s not as good looking as you like i m already dead and i think i ll take you i ll take you with me,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
"I’ve been reflecting lately, and I just feel really grateful for everything and everyone that I have in my life.",i m grateful that now i can see that i am a part of everything and everything is a part of me you ve amazed me,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song lyrics align perfectly with the user's emotional state of gratitude, reflecting a deep appreciation for life and interconnectedness, which matches the user's feelings of being grateful for everything and everyone. The context of gratitude and reflection is directly addressed in the lyrics, making it highly relevant. The lyrics are mostly coherent and fluently express the theme of gratitude, though they could benefit from slightly more clarity or detail to enhance understanding."
"Someone very important to me is gone, and no matter how much time passes, I still feel the weight of that loss.",i ve been so long without you i try not to think about you but i do i know that i m to blame i got no right to call your name but i do i do i m so hurt to think that you d lie to me i m hurt way down deep inside of me,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song chosen reflects a strong sense of loss and longing, aligning well with the user's emotional state of missing someone important. The lyrics express a deep hurt and a struggle with the absence of a loved one, which resonates with the user's feelings of enduring the weight of loss. However, the song also includes elements of betrayal ('to think that you'd lie to me'), which might not completely align with the user's context if their loss was not due to deceit. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express the pain of missing someone, though the focus on betrayal slightly diverts from the exact context of the user's emotional prompt."
I've been smiling for the last three hours. I can't believe this is my life,i used to be a fool and think that life was cruel and full of hate but now i see things are not so bad if only i had had someone to hold my hand like you i d do it then i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now and now that i am free from all that misery and i can smile again cause you came into my life said you d be my wife and made me realize that life is wonderful and i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song perfectly aligns with the user's emotional state of happiness and disbelief at their current life situation, scoring a 5 in emotional alignment. It also matches the context of a significant positive change in life, as reflected in the lyrics about transitioning from a state of misery to happiness due to a supportive relationship, thus scoring a 5 in contextual relevance. The lyrics are repetitive but maintain a clear narrative about the transformation brought by a loved one, earning a 4 in lyrical coherence. The overall score is 4.7, reflecting a strong match to the user's prompt."
There’s someone I can’t stop thinking about lately. I think I’m in love with them.,close my eyes and there she is just laughing and she knows that i want her to love me until im dead for a second there she is just laughing in my mind she knows i want to i love her i love her i love her i love her i love her i love her,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics strongly align with the emotional aspect of the user's prompt, which describes an intense and persistent feeling of love towards someone. The repetition of 'I love her' captures the obsessive nature of the user's thoughts. Contextually, the song fits well as it revolves around the theme of unrequited love and longing, which might be inferred from the user's uncertainty about their feelings being reciprocated. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low. The repetitive structure and lack of variety in expression might make the lyrics seem disjointed or overly simplistic, which could detract from the listener's experience."
I stood in front of a huge and wasn't able to blurt out a single sentence. My knees were shaking the whole time.,this one brought me down to my knees i had to hold onto the wall my knees shaking quivering my head feels like a frisbee,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The recommended song lyrics align well emotionally with the user's prompt, as they describe a physical reaction of being brought down to one's knees and experiencing shaking, similar to the user's description of shaking knees. Contextually, the song captures the overwhelming physical sensation which matches the user's experience in front of a huge audience, though it lacks direct reference to the cause of the stress (e.g., public speaking, audience). The lyrical coherence is somewhat lower as the lyrics are a bit disjointed and abstract, making it harder to follow a clear narrative or message."
I just know that tomorrow is going to be the best day ever,this is the first day of my life for once i m sure that this is where i long to be no need to know if there is something more than this no need to go cos there is nothing more than this my future is so clear cos everything s right here inside of me inside of me,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song's lyrics perfectly align with the user's emotional state of optimism and anticipation for a great day, scoring high in emotional alignment. The context of the song, which celebrates a significant, joyful new beginning, matches the user's feeling about tomorrow being the best day, thus scoring high in contextual relevance. The lyrics are mostly coherent and fluently express the joy and certainty of the moment, though some repetitive phrases slightly affect the clarity, leading to a slightly lower score in lyrical coherence."
"Today someone told me I don't belong, but I know that I must fight for my ideals and show them to the world!",she said why do you have to go no one out there knows you and i said you don t you just assume you think you are something you think you are something he said why do you have to go no one out there loves you so you re suppose to be my ideal can t even deal with yourself i need new heroes he said why do you have to go no one out there is shameless so you re supposed to be my ideal can t even deal with yourself i need i need i need new so you re supposed to be my ideal can t even deal with yourself i need new heroes,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song lyrics partially align with the emotional aspect of the user's prompt, reflecting feelings of rejection and misunderstanding ('no one out there loves you', 'no one out there knows you'). However, the song doesn't strongly convey the user's determination to fight for their ideals and show them to the world, focusing more on doubt and negativity. Contextually, the song mentions ideals, but in a negative light, which doesn't fully support the user's context of persevering and proving oneself. The lyrical coherence is low, as the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and disjointed, making it difficult to grasp a clear and fluent narrative or message."
"After going over the situation again, something finally clicked for me. I understand now what I didn’t see before.",i realised you saw right through this and you rise always i realised you re i realised you saw right through this and you rise always what made you right and didn t i free and didn t i solve and didn t i see what made you right and didn t i free and didn t i solve and didn t i see what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right ,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song lyrics reflect a realization and a sense of understanding, which aligns moderately with the user's emotional state of finally 'clicking' and understanding something previously unseen. However, the song's repetitive nature and lack of clear narrative or progression make it only somewhat relevant to the context of a new understanding or insight. The lyrics are highly repetitive and lack fluency, making it difficult to derive a coherent message or story, which significantly impacts the overall effectiveness of the song in matching the user's prompt."

This gives it a moderate score in emotional alignment. However, the context of the song, which involves going to another show and interacting in a social setting, doesn't perfectly align with the user's likely desire for tranquility and solitude post-show, thus the lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear, coherent narrative or emotional depth, leading to a lower score in lyrical coherence. Overall, while the song captures a laid-back atmosphere, it doesn't fully resonate with the specific emotional and contextual needs expressed in the user's prompt."
"The more I think about it, the more I realize I made a terrible mistake. I really regret what I did.",i thought about sitting on the floor in second grade i couldn t keep the pace i thought i was the only one moving in slow motion while the other kids knew something i did not but if i acted like a clown i thought it d get me throughit did but that don t work no more you re not a kid no more i thought i d do some traveling never did regrets regrets i thought about the hours wasted watching tv drinking beer i thought about the things i thought about until immobilized with fear and all the great ideas i had and how we just made fun of those who had the guts to try and fail and then i ended up in jail regrets regrets in for a day seems the police had make a computer mistake said there must be thousands like me with the same name anyway i thought about the things i settled for or never tried i never visited my grandma even once when she was sick before she died so i don t blame you if you never come to see me here again regrets regrets1,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of regret and introspection, aligning well with the user's emotional state of realizing a past mistake and feeling remorse. The contextual relevance is also high, as the lyrics delve into personal anecdotes of missed opportunities and mistakes, mirroring the user's sentiment of regret. However, the lyrical coherence scores slightly lower due to a somewhat disjointed narrative that jumps between different life events and thoughts, which might make it harder for the listener to follow a clear storyline. Overall, the song resonates well with the theme of regret and missed chances, making it a suitable choice for the user's emotional and contextual needs."

I just feel this overwhelming sadness I don’t know how to handle.,i can t take anymore i can t breathe i m sick of this goddamn darkness sick of sadness and tears i throw it all up every single day together with last night s dinner i have lost myself completely i have convinced myself i am someone else for god s sake i need to be real i need touch i need people i have to turn my life around but i will still be myself won t i ,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics chosen align well with the user's emotional state of overwhelming sadness and the inability to cope, as reflected in the lyrics expressing feelings of suffocation, darkness, and constant sadness. This results in a high score for emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on themes of personal struggle and the need for change, which is somewhat relevant to the user's feelings of being overwhelmed and lost, though it does not directly address the process of managing or overcoming these feelings, leading to a moderate score. The lyrical coherence is somewhat low due to the lack of punctuation and disjointed thoughts, which might make it harder for the user to fully connect with or understand the message, impacting the overall effectiveness of the song as a therapeutic tool."
My family just told me something completely unexpected... I’m still trying to wrap my head around it.,sometimes life surprises because you d never expect it to be that dangerous disguises that you never expect to see some things never change nothing s going to change that some things you can t explain like why we re all embracing conventional wisdom in a world that s just so unconventional made you turn around but you never expected to see that that s what makes that sound that you never expect to hear they don t know they re wrong but you know that they never can see that that s what makes them strong that they know that we ll never see1,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect the emotion of surprise and unexpectedness, aligning well with the user's emotional state, hence scoring high on emotional alignment. The context of the song, discussing life's unpredictability and the strength derived from unseen challenges, is somewhat relevant to the user's situation of dealing with unexpected family news, though it's not a direct match. The lyrical coherence is lower as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making it harder to follow a clear narrative or message."
