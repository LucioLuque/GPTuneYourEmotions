Watching my teammate stay late to coach the interns after hours left me genuinely inspired.,they had been listening to our music and was inspired by what we did and just the fact that ya know big pun was covering it and getting at me to be in the video it made me feel good like a legend before my times they did that like nobody else could do that cause that was one of those classic records that was like if you touch it you gotta really know what you doing or you really mess up the ingredients and they touched it and really put they own ingredients on it to make it sound real smooth

I can’t stop wondering what the northern lights look like in person.,if i could take a look through picture frames and books i wonder what it is i d see cities lights and sunsets faces i dont know yet think of what the time can bring run like rivers chasing dreams i kiss you in the city streets see young hwart with a brand new point of view when we grow old well turn the pages take a look back down through the ages it was bright all this life i lived with you if i could take a look through picture frames and books i wonder what it is i d see
It's only Tuesday and I'm already day-dreaming about sinking into a hammock by the sea in my weekend.,so here i go i ll dive right in break through the waves straight to the ocean floor and although my hands are shaking i lie perfectly still cause i m determined to let myself sink down and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again i could wave my arms and swim away but never reach the shore but for now i will lay face first in the sand with the wreckage from ships that lost their way and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again and although my hands are shaking i lie perfectly still cause i m determined to let myself sink down and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again
Spent a week on that proposal and it didn’t even make the meeting agenda—ouch.,not submitted
My teammate keeps blaring voice notes on speaker in the open office; I swear earbuds were invented for a reason.,maybe there are cartwheels in your mouth maybe your words will grow up to be a gymnasts maybe you have been kicking people with them by accident i know some people get a whole lot of rocking in the rocking chair and the ones who dont sometimes get rocks in their voice boxes and their voice boxes become slingshots maybe you think my heart looks like a baby squirrel but you absolutely missed when you told the class i have head lice cause i one hundred percent absolutely do not have head lice and even if i do it is a fact that head lice prefer clean heads over dirty ones so i am clean as a whistle on a tea pot my mother says it is totally fine if i blow off steam as long as i speak in an octave my kindness can still reach my kindness knows mermaids never ever miss their legs in the water cause there are better ways to move through the ocean than kicking so guess what if i ever have my own team i am picking everyone first even the worst kid and the kid with the stutter like a skipping record cause i know all of us are scratched even if you cant hear it when we speak my mother says most people have heartbeats that are knocking on doors that will never open and i know my heart is a broken freezer chest cause i can never keep anything frozen so no i am not always crying i am just thawing outside of the lines and even if i am always crying it is a fact that salt is the only reason everything floats so good in the dead sea and just cause no one ever passes notes to me doesnt mean i am not super duper in fact my super duper might be a buoy or a paper boat the next time your nose gets stuck up the river cause it is a fact that our hearts stop every for a milli second every time we sneeze and some peoples houses have too much dust some peoples fathers are like attics ive heard attics have monsters in their walls and shaky stares i think if i lived in a house with attic id nightmare a burglar in my safety chest and maybe id look for rest in the sticks and stones cause my mother says a person can only swallow so much punch before hes drunk on his own fist but the only drunk i ever knew was sleeping in the alley behind our church and jesus turned water into his wine so even god has his bad days but on your bad days couldnt you just say hey im having a bad day instead of telling me im stupid or poor or telling me i dress like a boy cause maybe i am a boy and a girl maybe my name is andrea andrew so what it is a fact that bumblebees have hair on their eyes and humans also should comb though everything they see like an anchorman is not a sailor like the clouds might be a pillow fight like my mother says every bird perched on a telephone wire will listen to the conversations running through its feet to decide the direction of its flight so i know every word we speak can make hurricanes in peoples weather veins or shine their shiny shine so maybe sometime you could sit beside me on the bus and i could say guess what it is a fact that manatees have vocal chords but do not have ears and beethoven made music even when he could no longer hear and i know every belt that has hit someones back is still a belt that was built to hold something up and it is fact that egyptians slept on pillows made of stone but its not hard for me to dream that maybe one day youll write me back like the day i wrote the lightening bug to say i smashed my mason jar and i threw away the lid i didnt want to take a chance that id grow up to be a war i want to be a belly dance or an accordion or a pogo stick or the fingerprints the mason left in the mortar between the bricks to prove that he was here that he built a roof over someones head to keep the storm from their faith my mother says thats why we all were born and i think shes right so write back soon sincerely yours 1
Opened the fridge and the sour-milk smell nearly knocked me over.,i woke up covered in sand it s not so ugly now i ve seen its face oh i can hear it breathing it bites my thumb i throw it at the wall i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm it didn t take too long only bout an hour in the coals we all sat down to eat it the meal was burnt i cut my gums on bone i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm and as blue as my back  i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm and the moon was the size of my hand
"I started presenting, then realized the slide on screen was upside down—facepalm moment.",i tell you there are no big shots in reality y all we re all in the same boat dealing with the same issues same problems same stuff don t even buy it all the perpetration you know all this we don t have problems that s a lie that s a lie i know that the enemy is doing the same thing to me that he s doing to everybody else i just know now that the only way to get out is through confrontation see we always thought it was retreat you know run away and i m telling you you got to confront it this is a strange song because this song when this song was written this is when everything sort of stopped it was written a long time ago but it was right before god just snatched me out of everything and because i didn t understand initially it was written i d written it about the whole amadou diallo situation when it first happened and i went to the studio and i laid it down and it was like strong for the first day and then it just regressed everyday after that and i said what s going on what s happening and at the end of it there was a word that i used rebel and i guess was afraid it was such a hot time in the city at that point i was afraid that if i put the record out people would misunderstand what i meant by rebel and they d just take it to the streets so i was very intimidated and afraid and before i knew it a whole host of things happened everything stopped after that and the creativity stopped everything stopped that s when i realized i had to understand what i was talking about before i could tell somebody else what i was talking about and i had to be you know a living example it s real crazy because i don t know what the press is saying because i don t listen to the press too much but i know the view is that i m emotionally unstable which is reality like you aren t i m laughing because what i ve realized i ve become is one of those mad scientists who does the tests on themselves first you see to make sure that they work and that s when you know ok look i got something that works you know what i m saying i m not gonna give you something that i haven t tested for myself and you go through and you re learning by way of experience and you re making mistakes and you re getting up a friend of mine once said to me he said look if we weren t supposed to turn around why does a car have a steering wheel are we just supposed to crash into the wall no we re supposed to say listen i was going the wrong way reverse in this particular song now i realize that this song is about freedom you see we could look at one human being but it s about the spirit of freedom being taken out and how it s taken out in all of us the song is called i find it hard to say bear with me a little bit

Waiting outside the dentist’s room; my knee won’t stop bouncing.,bad blood saturating the sheets and the blankets good god there are ghosts floating up from the pavement they flip over the houses blood runs out from the basements in its unholy flow you remember this whimpering thick nauseous feeling from your step brother chasing you around with a staple gun when you were young it was fun and then suddenly pain became a very real thing do you remember that feeling similarly this isnt fiction well actually mostly it is or a series of irl moments cloaked in the vagueness that songs give but when theres nothing to say and youve got to say something fuck i dont even know we pass on the street and say hi cause we have to even though both of us are clearly just like i fucking hate you so stilted and silent not awkward just angry hey i gotta go but ill see you at the show its that song everybody loves but the are garbage and it stresses me out how often youre mentioned its like everyone we know collectively vomited up a pile of brown sweaters or something and were so impressed with the results that they put them on the wall and im so sad youre in my head and im so sorry its so venomous especially because weve got like maybe four or five words ever spoken between us but i cant heave my heart into my mouth i cant tell you i cant stop you i dont want to this first day of school shit just seems to keep happening everybody says man its so cool were so glad youre doing your own thing but worse than disdain is colossal indifference the smiles are so big and theres no one at the gig im either deep in the woods or on tv for everyone and i know its disgusting how much i think about myself in relation to nothing the things that arent gonna stay just arent gonna stay like i was getting a tooth pulled in the free clinic in portland in 2007 the dentist turned out to be this dude a drummer whose band id recorded and somehow that was comforting then the novocaine block kicked in it closed up my throat and i was ready to go home maybe once this record comes out then i can stop drinking that might look good on a press release or something if they even still do those wait im certain they still do those and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes
