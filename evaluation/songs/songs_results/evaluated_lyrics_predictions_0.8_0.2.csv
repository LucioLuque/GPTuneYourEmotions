Watching my teammate stay late to coach the interns after hours left me genuinely inspired.,we could stay up all night talking fall asleep together on the couch every now and then i d open at my eyes to ensure that you are still around and you are endlessly surprising and i i feel everything i feel everything i feel everything you call me to see if my job interview had gone well you don t know how much that helped i wanna give you a part of myself neither of our lives are going that well but you are undeniably good and i don t need anyone to tell me who i should or shouldn t be when i close my eyes i see a shining image of you and me somewhere far away or right here in this living room and you could easily say that it was worth it oh it was worth it everything was worth it everything was worth it everything was worth it to feel this good today,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song captures a sense of inspiration and support, aligning well with the emotion of being inspired by a teammate's dedication (Emotional alignment: 4). The lyrics reflect themes of support and companionship, somewhat relevant to the context of coaching and mentoring, though not directly about professional or skill development (Contextual relevance: 3). The lyrics are generally coherent, maintaining a consistent narrative about mutual support and appreciation, though they can be somewhat repetitive (Lyrical coherence: 4). Overall, the song resonates with the sentiment of the prompt but could align more closely with the specific context of coaching interns."
That clip of a golden retriever chasing bubbles still has me giggling at my desk.,get back get back get back get back get back hey you why why i laugh ,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.67,"The song's repetitive use of 'get back' and 'laugh' loosely connects to the emotion of amusement derived from watching a playful scene involving a dog. However, the lyrics lack depth and context that directly relate to the joy and lightheartedness of watching a golden retriever chase bubbles. The lyrics are also somewhat disjointed and lack fluency, making it difficult to derive a clear narrative or emotional journey from them."
The courier dumped my brand-new keyboard in a puddle and walked off—I'm fuming.,i m a self searching man at least i thought i was in those days i m okay i spose but still i snort up loads of cocaine they say it s down to mistrust abandonment and self hate i stare em in the eye and cry to fuck em if it felt great i struggle in myself place a bubble built around my life and if i haven t been a part of nothing in my pounding mind then fuck it i ll just sit within a grin and pick another time and distance in to mix the gin and substance in my fucking life cuz nothing knows the love inside feel it but the valve is clocked pissing out the liquids by the thousands to the fountain pots and none of your umbrellas could resist the muddy pounding drops with every dripping tear and all the shouting in this house i ve locked so try breaking in and see how far your candle burns it s pitch black forever in this mountain of abandoned words mismatching tenants in a crowded vegetated patch staring at the rusty jerrycan again now take a match one simple weed smoking alcoholic tosser one little key opens out your options proper stomp on the beat talk shit and down a vodka stop living weak own a house and see the doctor until the flames collapse i m comforting the heat i know it takes a man to stab a drunkard to his feet but i m tired the crusade of facts has played a random help but who s brain is who s mate i can t be arsed to slap myself it s never my fault i ve come to terms on my denial it seems to be the only thing to serve my custom of a smile the grief beneath the sober thing that burns enough to comfort sid before i m rich and bubbling i m eating out the fucking bin so fuck the normal way with corners i m just walking straight fuck a spoon fuck a knife i m all about the fork to face i m walking round my awkward mates that weep outside this doorstep and force stress deep inside a portion of my boring head i was pulled out with forceps i didn t wanna leave the womb i didn t wanna see the truth i didn t wanna breathe cuz it s a disgusting mistrusting dustbin we sit fucked in lusting for drug fixes fixed lost in nothing ,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of anger and frustration due to a specific incident involving a courier and a damaged keyboard. The song's themes of self-destruction, substance abuse, and deep personal turmoil diverge significantly from the user's situation. The lyrics are complex and somewhat chaotic, which does not provide a clear or coherent narrative that could be relevant or therapeutic to the user's current emotional context. The overall coherence of the lyrics is low, as they jump between various intense personal issues without a clear thread, making it difficult to draw relevance or solace for the user's specific circumstance."
The elevator keeps dinging on every floor even when nobody’s inside; it’s testing my patience.,i wake to feel it all like a drum inside my chest pulled the cable from the wall but the buzzing never rests now i gotta go and you re unimpressed my choices never small and you know i never rest but you always see me fall i can t stop it cause now we re losing light i can t stop it let s sleep on it another night hours passing losing light if you re wondering let s sleep on it another night what d you come here for dodging me like a swinging door i know what you re waiting for but your patience wore out fast i gotta go and i m unimpressed my choices never small and you know i never rest and you can t catch my fall,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
My colleague refactored the legacy code and now it runs twice as fast—exactly what we needed.,we have the technology we have the technology1,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song's repeated phrase 'we have the technology' loosely aligns with the theme of technological improvement or enhancement, which is somewhat relevant to the context of refactoring code to improve performance. However, the emotional alignment is moderate as the song does not explicitly convey feelings of accomplishment or satisfaction that might be associated with the successful optimization of code. The lyrical coherence is low due to the repetitive and limited nature of the lyrics, which does not provide a clear or fluent narrative or message."
"Let me know the moment you get home so I can relax, please.",do you want me to go i ll drive home it s alright hold the thought so tightly it was just a passing thing come inside have a seat i ll be with you soon you don t seem to have feeling turn the lights off when you leave,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song's emotional alignment scores a 2 as it touches slightly on themes of concern and waiting, which aligns somewhat with the user's need for reassurance once someone is safely home. However, the song's context is more about someone possibly leaving or being in a state of emotional disconnect, which doesn't align well with the user's prompt about wanting to know when someone arrives home safely, hence a contextual score of 1. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative, making it difficult to fully grasp the intended message, leading to a coherence score of 2. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."

I’m completely lost.,why oh why oh why oh why why oh why oh why because because because because goodbye goodbye goodbye why can t a bird eat an elephant why oh why oh why cause an elephant s got a pretty hard skin goodby goodbye goodbye why can t a mouse eat a streetcar why oh why oh why cause a mouse s stomach could never hold a streetcar goodbye goodbye goodbye why does a horn make music why oh why oh why cause the horn blower blows it goodbye goodbye goodbye why does a cow drink water tell me why and why because the cow gets thirsty just like you or me goodye goodbye goodbye why oh why oh why oh why why oh why oh why because because because because goodbye goodbye goodbye why won t you answer my questions why oh why oh why cause i don t know the answers goodbye goodbye goodbye why s there no pennies for ice cream why oh why oh why you put all the pennies in the telephone dear goodbye goodbye goodbye why can t a rabbit chase an eagle tell me why oh why because because why ain t my grandpa my grandma why oh why oh why same reason your dad s not your mommy goodbye goodbye goodbye why couldn t the wind blow backwards why oh why oh why cause it might backfire and hurt somebody goodbye goodbye goodbye why oh why oh why oh why why oh why oh why oh why because because because because goodbye goodbye goodbye,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The song lyrics are a series of nonsensical questions and answers, which do not align well with the user's frustration about the website's checkout buttons. The emotional alignment is low because the song's whimsical tone contrasts sharply with the user's likely frustration and confusion. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it does not address or relate to website navigation or user interface issues. The lyrical coherence is also low, as the lyrics are repetitive and lack a clear, logical flow, making them difficult to relate to the user's situation."
I can’t stop wondering what the northern lights look like in person.,cut from the window pane over my bed out to the winter trails and where they have led i ve seen a few things going by and i still wonder why it becomes night cut from the riverbank is where you have bled out to the logging trails and where they have led i ve seen a few things going by and i still wonder why it becomes night,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.3,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of wonder and introspection, which aligns somewhat with the user's emotional state of curiosity about the northern lights. However, the emotional connection is not very strong as the lyrics focus more on a general sense of wonder rather than the specific awe and beauty associated with the northern lights. Contextually, the lyrics mention winter trails and night, which can be loosely connected to the idea of viewing the northern lights in a cold, northern environment. However, the connection is indirect and does not specifically address the northern lights or a similar visual experience. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and vague, making it difficult to grasp a clear narrative or thematic depth."
It's only Tuesday and I'm already day-dreaming about sinking into a hammock by the sea in my weekend.,well the dawn is breaking on a week of days so i best get up and be on my way grab my hat and put on my shoes but i got me a case of them monday blues them monday blues them monday blues got me a case of them monday blues well i punch the clock when the work begins but all day long i m wishing it would end i feel the same the whole week through and it s friday before i finally lose these monday blues them monday blues got me a case of them monday blues saturdays never long enough cause it s over just when i m warming up sunday comes and i m settled in then before you know it here i go again with those monday blues them monday blues got me a case of them monday blues,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.67,"The song lyrics primarily focus on the dread and monotony associated with the start of the workweek, particularly emphasizing the 'Monday blues.' This contrasts significantly with the user's prompt, which expresses a longing for relaxation by the sea over the weekend. Therefore, the emotional alignment is low as the song conveys a sense of frustration and weariness rather than anticipation and daydreaming. The contextual relevance is also low because the song revolves around the workweek's challenges rather than the leisure and escape anticipated in the user's weekend plans. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent theme and narrative about the weekly work cycle, which earns a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
Spent a week on that proposal and it didn’t even make the meeting agenda—ouch.,you heard the sun today there she blows there she blows you saw the wind a shining you don t know you don t know you felt a tree that does fall you don t know that s ok you don t have much taste for bouquet i m bored with the valleys and bored with the peaks so i bought a ticket to the freaks i saw a chicken with two heads saw something else that was headless then p t said see the egress cause you move when the salesman speaks i superabound but i still got nothing to do a space is made by telephone they thought time would be overthrown and they compiled a wish list from mars duels to a dish kissed i tried to talk to the ishist but he was debating with his clone i superabound but i still got nothing to do well they thought it was a coup but they still got nothing to do you must see my domicile i had it built in decastyle the other day at the potlatch come visiting was a sasquatch he said although i m a mismatch could i stay just for awhile cause the likes of us are few yeah and we still got nothing to do i superabound but i still got nothing to do,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The emotional alignment of the song with the user's prompt is low. The user feels frustration and disappointment, which the song does not directly address with its abstract and whimsical lyrics about surreal and bizarre scenarios. The contextual relevance is also low as the song's themes of boredom and surreal experiences do not align with the user's specific situation of a professional setback. The lyrical coherence is slightly better, as the song maintains a consistent style of abstract and whimsical imagery, though it may still be confusing and lacks a clear narrative or message. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional or contextual needs."
My teammate keeps blaring voice notes on speaker in the open office; I swear earbuds were invented for a reason.,a recent and indifferent impressions in the dream if i now consult my own experience with regard to the origin of the elements appearing in the dream content i must in the first place express the opinion that in every dream we may find some reference to the experiences of the preceding day whatever dream i turn to whether my own or someone else s this experience is always confirmed knowing this i may perhaps begin the work of interpretation by looking for the experience of the preceding day which has stimulated the dream in many cases this is indeed the quickest way with the two dreams which i subjected to a close analysis in the last chapter the reference to the preceding day is so evident that it needs no further elucidation but in order to show how constantly this reference may be demonstrated i shall examine a portion of my own dream chronicle i shall relate only so much of the dreams as is necessary for the detection of the dream source in question 1 i pay a call at a house to which i gain admittance only with difficulty etc and meanwhile i am keeping a woman waiting for me source a conversation during the evening with a female relative to the effect that she would have to wait for a remittance for which she had asked until etc 2 i have written a monograph on a species of plant source in the morning i had seen in a bookseller s window a monograph on the genus cyclamen 3 i see two women in the street mother and daughter the latter being a patient source a female patient who is under treatment had told me in the evening what difficulties her mother puts in the way of her continuing the treatment 4 at s and r s bookshop i subscribe to a periodical which costs 20 florins annually source during the day my wife has reminded me that i still owe her 20 florins of her weekly allowance 5 i receive a communication from the social democratic committee in which i am addressed as a member source i have received simultaneous communications from the liberal committee on elections and from the president of the humanitarian society of which latter i am actually a member 6 a man on a steep rock rising from the sea in the manner of bocklin source dreyfus on devil s island also news from my relatives in england etc the question might be raised whether a dream invariably refers to the events of the preceding day only or whether the reference may be extended to include impressions from a longer period of time in the immediate past this question is probably not of the first importance but i am inclined to decide in favour of the exclusive priority of the day before the dream whenever i thought i had found a case where an impression two or three days old was the source of the dream i was able to convince myself after careful investigation that this impression had been remembered the day before that is that a demonstrable reproduction on the day before had been interpolated between the day of the event and the time of the dream and further i was able to point to the recent occasion which might have given rise to the recollection of the older impression on the other hand i was unable to convince myself that a regular interval of biological significance elapses between the dream exciting daytime impression and its recurrence in the dream i believe therefore that for every dream a dream stimulus may be found among these experiences on which one has not yet slept havelock ellis who has likewise given attention to this problem states that he has not been able to find any such periodicity of reproduction in his dreams although he has looked for it he relates a dream in which he found himself in spain he wanted to travel to a place called daraus varaus or zaraus on awaking he was unable to recall any such place names and thought no more of the matter a few months later he actually found the name zaraus it was that of a railway station between san sebastian and bilbao through which he had passed in the train eight months before the date of the dream thus the impressions of the immediate past stand in the same relation to the dream content as those of periods indefinitely remote the dream may select its material from any period of life provided only that a chain of thought leads back from the experiences of the day of the dream of that earlier period but why this preference for recent impressions we shall arrive at some conjectures on this point if we subject one of the dreams already mentioned to a more precise analysis i select the dream of the botanical monograph i have written a monograph on a certain plant the book lies before me i am just turning over a folded coloured plate a dried specimen of the plant as though from a herbarium is bound up with every copy analysis in the morning i saw in a bookseller s window a volume entitled the genus cyclamen apparently a monograph on this plant the cyclamen is my wife s favorite flower i reproach myself for remembering so seldom to bring her flowers as she would like me to do in connection with the theme of giving her flowers i am reminded of a story which i recently told some friends of mine in proof of my assertion that we often forget in obedience to a purpose of the unconscious and that forgetfulness always enables us to form a deduction about the secret disposition of the forgetful person a young woman who has been accustomed to receive a bouquet of flowers from her husband on her birthday misses this token of affection on one of her birthdays and bursts into tears the husband comes in and cannot understand why she is crying until she tells him today is my birthday he claps his hand to his forehead and exclaims oh forgive me i had completely forgotten it and proposes to go out immediately in order to get her flowers but she refuses to be consoled for she sees in her husband s forgetfulness a proof that she no longer plays the same part in his thoughts as she formerly did this frau l met my wife two days ago told her that she was feeling well and asked after me some years ago she was a patient of mine supplementary facts i did once actually write something like a monograph on a plant namely an essay on the coca plant which attracted the attention of k koller to the anaesthetic properties of cocaine i had hinted that the alkaloid might be employed as an anaesthetic but i was not thorough enough to pursue the matter farther it occurs to me too that on the morning of the day following the dream i had thought of cocaine in a kind of day dream if i were ever afflicted with glaucoma i would go to berlin and there undergo an operation incognito in the house of my berlin friend at the hands of a surgeon whom he would recommend the surgeon who would not know the name of his patient would boast as usual how easy these operations had become since the introduction of cocaine and i should not betray the fact that i myself had a share in this discovery with this phantasy were connected thoughts of how awkward it really is for a physician to claim the professional services of a colleague i should be able to pay the berlin eye specialist who did not know me like anyone else only after recalling this day dream do i realize that there is concealed behind it the memory of a definite event shortly after koller s discovery my father contracted glaucoma he was operated on by my friend dr koenigstein the eye specialist dr koller was in charge of the cocaine anaesthetization and he made the remark that on this occasion all the three persons who had been responsible for the introduction of cocaine had been brought together my thoughts now pass on to the time when i was last reminded of the history of cocaine this was a few days earlier when i received a festschrift a publication in which grateful pupils had commemorated the jubilee of their teacher and laboratory director among the titles to fame of persons connected with the laboratory i found a note to the effect that the discovery of the anaesthetic properties of cocaine had been due to k koller now i suddenly become aware that the dream is connected with an experience of the previous evening i had just accompanied dr koenigstein to his home and had entered into a discussion of a subject which excites me greatly whenever it is mentioned while i was talking with him in the entrance hall professor gartner and his young wife came up i could not refrain from congratulating them both upon their blooming appearance now professor gartner is one of the authors of the festschrift of which i have just spoken and he may well have reminded me of it and frau l of whose birthday disappointment i spoke a little way back had been mentioned though of course in another connection in my conversation with dr koenigstein i shall now try to elucidate the other determinants of the dream content a dried specimen of the plant accompanies the monograph as though it were a herbarium and herbarium reminds me of the gymnasium the director of our gymnasium once called the pupils of the upper classes together in order that they might examine and clean the gymnasium herbarium small insects had been found book worms the director seemed to have little confidence in my ability to assist for he entrusted me with only a few of the pages i know to this day that there were crucifers on them my interest in botany was never very great at my preliminary examination in botany i was required to identify a crucifer and failed to recognize it had not my theoretical knowledge come to my aid i should have fared badly indeed crucifers suggest composites the artichoke is really a composite and in actual fact one which i might call my favourite flower my wife more thoughtful than i often brings this favourite flower of mine home from the market i see the monograph which i have written lying before me here again there is an association my friend wrote to me yesterday from berlin i am thinking a great deal about your dream book i see it lying before me completed and i turn the pages how i envied him this power of vision if only i could see it lying before me already completed the folded coloured plate when i was a medical student i suffered a sort of craze for studying monographs exclusively in spite of my limited means i subscribed to a number of the medical periodicals whose coloured plates afforded me much delight i was rather proud of this inclination to thoroughness when i subsequently began to publish books myself i had to draw the plates for my own treatises and i remember one of them turned out so badly that a well meaning colleague ridiculed me for it with this is associated i do not exactly know how a very early memory of my childhood my father by the way of a jest once gave my elder sister and myself a book containing coloured plates in order that we might destroy it from an educational point of view this was hardly to be commended i was at the time five years old and my sister less than three and the picture of us two children blissfully tearing the book to pieces is almost the only one from this period of my life which has remained vivid in my memory when i afterwards became a student i developed a conspicuous fondness for collecting and possessing books i became a book worm ever since i have been engaged in introspection i have always traced this earliest passion of my life to this impression of my childhood or rather i have recognized in this childish scene a screen or concealing memory for my subsequent bibliophilia and of course i learned at an early age that our passions often become our misfortunes when i was seventeen i ran up a very considerable account at the bookseller s with no means with which to settle it and my father would hardly accept it as an excuse that my passion was at least a respectable one but the mention of this experience of my youth brings me back to my conversation with my friend dr koenigstein on the evening preceding the dream for one of the themes of this conversation was the same old reproach that i am much too absorbed in my hobbies for reasons which are not relevant here i shall not continue the interpretation of this dream but will merely indicate the path which leads to it in the course of the interpretation i was reminded of my conversation with dr koenigstein and indeed of more than one portion of it when i consider the subjects touched upon in this conversation the meaning of the dream immediately becomes clear to me all the trains of thought which have been started my own inclinations and those of my wife the cocaine the awkwardness of securing medical treatment from one s own colleagues my preference for monographical studies and my neglect of certain subjects such as botany all these are continued in and lead up to one branch or another of this widely ramified conversation the dream once more assumes the character of a justification of a plea for my rights it even continues the theme which that dream introduced and discusses it in association with the new subject matter which has been added in the interval between the two dreams even the dream s apparently indifferent form of expression at once acquires a meaning now it means i am indeed the man who has written that valuable and successful treatise just as previously i declared in self justification i am after all a thorough and industrious student and in both instances i find the meaning i can allow myself this but i may dispense with the further interpretation of the dream because my only purpose in recording it was to examine the relation of the dream content to the experience of the previous day which arouses it as long as i know only the manifest content of this dream only one relation to any impression of the day is obvious but after i have completed the interpretation a second source of the dream becomes apparent in another experience of the same day the first of these impressions to which the dream refers is an indifferent one a subordinate circumstance i see a book in a shop window whose title holds me for a moment but whose contents would hardly interest me the second experience was of great psychic value i talked earnestly with my friend the eye specialist for about an hour i made allusions in this conversation which must have ruffled the feelings of both of us and which in me awakened memories in connection with which i was aware of a great variety of inner stimuli further this conversation was broken off unfinished because some acquaintances joined us what now is the relation of these two impressions of the day to one another and to the dream which followed during the night in the manifest dream content i find merely an allusion to the indifferent impression and i am thus able to reaffirm that the dream prefers to take up into its content experiences of a non essential character in the dream interpretation on the contrary everything converges upon the important and justifiably disturbing event if i judge the sense of the dream in the only correct way according to the latent content which is brought to light in the analysis i find that i have unwittingly lighted upon a new and important discovery i see that the puzzling theory that the dream deals only with the worthless odds and ends of the day s experiences has no justification i am also compelled to contradict the assertion that the psychic life of the waking state is not continued in the dream and that hence the dream wastes our psychic energy on trivial material the very opposite is true what has claimed our attention during the day dominates our dream thoughts also and we take pains to dream only in connection with such matters as have given us food for thought during the day perhaps the most immediate explanation of the fact that i dream of the indifferent impression of the day while the impression which has with good reason excited me causes me to dream is that here again we are dealing with the phenomenon of dream distortion which we have referred to as a psychic force playing the part of a censorship the recollection of the monograph on the genus cyclamen is utilized as though it were an allusion to the conversation with my friend just as the mention of my patient s friend in the dream of the deferred supper is represented by the allusion smoked salmon the only question is by what intermediate links can the impression of the monograph come to assume the relation of allusion to the conversation with the eye specialist since such a relation is not at first perceptible in the example of the deferred supper the relation is evident at the outset smoked salmon as the favourite dish of the patient s friend belongs to the circle of ideas which the friend s personality would naturally evoke in the mind of the dreamer in our new example we are dealing with two entirely separate impressions which at first glance seem to have nothing in common except indeed that they occur on the same day the monograph attracts my attention in the morning in the evening i take part in the conversation the answer furnished by the analysis is as follows such relations between the two impressions as do not exist from the first are established subsequently between the idea content of the one impression and the idea content of the other i have already picked out the intermediate links emphasized in the course of writing the analysis only under some outside influence perhaps the recollection of the flowers missed by frau l would the idea of the monograph on the cyclamen have attached itself to the idea that the cyclamen is my wife s favourite flower i do not believe that these inconspicuous thoughts would have sufficed to evoke a dream there needs no ghost my lord come from the grave to tell us this as we read in hamlet but behold in the analysis i am reminded that the name of the man who interrupted our conversation was gartner and that i thought his wife looked blooming indeed now i even remember that one of my female patients who bears the pretty name of flora was for a time the main subject of our conversation it must have happened that by means of these intermediate links from the sphere of botanical ideas the association was effected between the two events of the day the indifferent one and the stimulating one other relations were then established that of cocaine for example which can with perfect appropriateness form a link between the person of dr koenigstein and the botanical monograph which i have written and thus secure the fusion of the two circles of ideas so that now a portion of the first experience may be used as an allusion to the second i am prepared to find this explanation attacked as either arbitrary or artificial what would have happened if professor gartner and his blooming wife had not appeared and if the patient who was under discussion had been called not flora but anna and yet the answer is not hard to find if these thought relations had not been available others would probably have been selected it is easy to establish relations of this sort as the jocular questions and conundrums with which we amuse ourselves suffice to show the range of wit is unlimited to go a step farther if no sufficiently fertile associations between the two impressions of the day could have been established the dream would simply have followed a different course another of the indifferent impressions of the day such as come to us in multitudes and are forgotten would have taken the place of the monograph in the dream would have formed an association with the content of the conversation and would have represented this in the dream since it was the impression of the monograph and no other that was fated to perform this function this impression was probably that most suitable for the purpose one need not like lessing s hanschen schlau be astonished that only the rich people of the world possess the most money still the psychological process by which according to our exposition the indifferent experience substitutes itself for the psychologically important one seems to us odd and open to question in a later chapter we shall undertake the task of making the peculiarities of this seemingly incorrect operation more intelligible here we are concerned only with the result of this process which we were compelled to accept by constantly recurring experiences in the analysis of dreams in this process it is as though in the course of the intermediate steps a displacement occurs let us say of the psychic accent until ideas of feeble potential by taking over the charge from ideas which have a stronger initial potential reach a degree of intensity which enables them to force their way into consciousness such displacements do not in the least surprise us when it is a question of the transference of affective magnitudes or of motor activities that the lonely spinster transfers her affection to animals that the bachelor becomes a passionate collector that the soldier defends a scrap of coloured cloth his flag with his life blood that in a love affair a clasp of the hands a moment longer than usual evokes a sensation of bliss or that in othello a lost handkerchief causes an outburst of rage all these are examples of psychic displacements which to us seem incontestable but if by the same means and in accordance with the same fundamental principles a decision is made as to what is to reach our consciousness and what is to be withheld from it that is to say what we are to think this gives us the impression of morbidity and if it occurs in waking life we call it an error of thought we may here anticipate the result of a discussion which will be undertaken later namely that the psychic process which we have recognized in dream displacement proves to be not a morbidly deranged process but one merely differing from the normal one of a more primary nature thus we interpret the fact that the dream content takes up remnants of trivial experiences as a manifestation of dream distortion and we thereupon remember that we have recognized this dream distortion as the work of a censorship operating between the two psychic instances we may therefore expect that dream analysis will constantly show us the real and psychically significant source of the dream in the events of the day the memory of which has transferred its accentuation to some indifferent memory this conception is in complete opposition to robert s theory which consequently has no further value for us the fact which robert was trying to explain simply does not exist its assumption is based on a misunderstanding on a failure to substitute the real meaning of the dream for its apparent meaning a further objection to robert s doctrine is as follows if the task of the dream were really to rid our memory by means of a special psychic activity of the slag of the day s recollections our sleep would perforce be more troubled engaged in more strenuous work than we can suppose it to be judging by our waking thoughts for the number of the indifferent impressions of the day against which we should have to protect our memory is obviously immeasurably large the whole night would not be long enough to dispose of them all it is far more probable that the forgetting of the indifferent impressions takes place without any active interference on the part of our psychic powers still something cautions us against taking leave of robert s theory without further consideration we have left unexplained the fact that one of the indifferent impressions of the day indeed even of the previous day constantly makes a contribution to the dream content the relations between this impression and the real source of the dream in the unconscious do not always exist from the outset as we have seen they are established subsequently while the dream is actually at work as though to serve the purpose of the intended displacement something therefore must necessitate the opening up of connections in the direction of the recent but indifferent impression this impression must possess some quality that gives it a special fitness otherwise it would be just as easy for the dream thoughts to shift their accentuation to some inessential component of their own sphere of ideas experiences such as the following show us the way to an explanation if the day has brought us two or more experiences which are worthy to evoke a dream the dream will blend the allusion of both into a single whole it obeys a compulsion to make them into a single whole for example one summer afternoon i entered a railway carriage in which i found two acquaintances of mine who were unknown to one another one of them was an influential colleague the other a member of a distinguished family which i had been attending in my professional capacity i introduced the two gentlemen to each other but during the long journey they conversed with each other through me so that i had to discuss this or that topic now with one now with the other i asked my colleague to recommend a mutual acquaintance who had just begun to practise as a physician he replied that he was convinced of the young man s ability but that his undistinguished appearance would make it difficult for him to obtain patients in the upper ranks of society to this i rejoined that is precisely why he needs recommendation a little later turning to my other fellow traveller i inquired after the health of his aunt the mother of one of my patients who was at this time prostrated by a serious illness on the night following this journey i dreamt that the young friend whom i had asked one of my companions to recommend was in a fashionable drawing room and with all the bearing of a man of the world was making before a distinguished company in which i recognized all the rich and aristocratic persons of my acquaintance a funeral oration over the old lady who was the aunt of my second fellow traveller thus my dream had once more found the connection between the two impressions of the day and by means of the two had constructed a unified situation in view of many similar experiences i am persuaded to advance the proposition that a dream works under a kind of compulsion which forces it to combine into a unified whole all the sources of dream stimulation which are offered to it in a subsequent chapter we shall consider this impulse of combination as part of the process of condensation another primary psychic process i shall now consider the question whether the dream exciting source to which our analysis leads us must always be a recent event or whether a subjective experience that is to say the recollection of a psychologically significant event a train of thought may assume the role of a dream stimulus the very definite answer derived from numerous analyses is as follows the stimulus of the dream may be a subjective transaction which has been made recent as it were by the mental activity of the day and this is perhaps the best time to summarize in schematic form the different conditions under which the dream sources are operative the source of a dream may be a recent and psychologically significant event which is directly represented in the dream several recent and significant events which are combined by the dream in a single whole one or more recent and significant events which are represented in the dream content by allusion to a contemporary but indifferent event a subjectively significant experience which is constantly represented in the dream by allusion to a recent but indifferent impression as may be seen in dream interpretation the condition is always fulfilled that one component of the dream content repeats a recent impression of the day of the dream the component which is destined to be represented in the dream may either belong to the same circle of ideas as the dream stimulus itself or it may originate in the neighbourhood of an indifferent impression which has been brought by more or less abundant associations into relation with the sphere of the dream stimulus the apparent multiplicity of these conditions results merely from the alternative that a displacement has or has not occurred and it may here be noted that this alternative enables us to explain the contrasts of the dream quite as readily as the medical theory of the dream explains the series of states from the partial to the complete waking of the brain cells in considering this series of sources we note further that the psychologically significant but not recent element may be replaced for the purposes of dream formation by a recent but psychologically indifferent element provided the two following conditions are fulfilled the dream content preserves a connection with things recently experienced the dream stimulus is still a psychologically significant event in one single case both these conditions are fulfilled by the same impression if we now consider that these same indifferent impressions which are utilized for the dream as long as they are recent lose this qualification as soon as they are a day older we are obliged to assume that the very freshness of an impression gives it a certain psychological value for dream formation somewhat equivalent to the value of emotionally accentuated memories or trains of thought later on in the light of certain psychological considerations we shall be able to divine the explanation of this importance of recent impressions in dream formation incidentally our attention is here called to the fact that at night and unnoticed by our consciousness important changes may occur in the material comprised by our ideas and memories the injunction that before making a final decision in any matter one should sleep on it for a night is obviously fully justified but at this point we find that we have passed from the psychology of dreaming to the psychology of sleep a step which there will often be occasion to take at this point there arises an objection which threatens to invalidate the conclusions at which we have just arrived if indifferent impressions can find their way into the dream only so long as they are of recent origin how does it happen that in the dream content we find elements also from earlier periods of our lives which at the time when they were still recent possessed as strumpell puts it no psychic value and which therefore ought to have been forgotten long ago elements that is which are neither fresh nor psychologically significant this objection can be disposed of completely if we have recourse to the results of the psychoanalysis of neurotics the solution is as follows the process of shifting and rearrangement which replaces material of psychic significance by material which is indifferent has already taken place in these earlier periods of life and has since become fixed in the memory those elements which were originally indifferent are in fact no longer so since they have acquired the value of psychologically significant material that which has actually remained indifferent can never be reproduced in the dream from the foregoing exposition the reader may rightly conclude that i assert that there are no indifferent dream stimuli and therefore no guileless dreams this i absolutely and unconditionally believe to be the case apart from the dreams of children and perhaps the brief dream reactions to nocturnal sensations apart from these exceptions whatever one dreams is either plainly recognizable as being psychically significant or it is distorted and can be judged correctly only after complete interpretation when it proves after all to be of psychic significance the dream never concerns itself with trifles we do not allow sleep to be disturbed by trivialities dreams which are apparently guileless turn out to be the reverse of innocent if one takes the trouble to interpret them if i may be permitted the expression they ail show the mark of the beast since this is another point on which i may expect contradiction and since i am glad of an opportunity to show dream distortion at work i shall here subject to analysis a number of guileless dreams from my collection i an intelligent and refined young woman who in real life is distinctly reserved one of those people of whom one says that still waters run deep relates the following dream i dreamt that i arrived at the market too late and could get nothing from either the butcher or the greengrocer woman surely a guileless dream but as it has not the appearance of a real dream i induce her to relate it in detail her report then runs as follows she goes to the market with her cook who carries the basket the butcher tells her after she has asked him for something that is no longer to be obtained and waits to give her something else with the remark that is good too she refuses and goes to the greengrocer woman the latter tries to sell her a peculiar vegetable which is bound up in bundles and is black in colour she says i don t know that i won t take it the connection of the dream with the preceding day is simple enough she had really gone to the market too late and had been unable to buy anything the meatshop was already closed comes into one s mind as a description of the experience but wait is not that a very vulgar phrase which or rather the opposite of which denotes a certain neglect with regard to man s clothing the dreamer has not used these words she has perhaps avoided them but let us look for the interpretation of the details contained in the dream when in a dream something has the character of a spoken utterance that is when it is said or heard not merely thought and the distinction can usually be made with certainty then it originates in the utterances of waking life which have of course been treated as raw material dismembered and slightly altered and above all removed from their context in the work of interpretation we may take such utterances as our starting point where then does the butcher s statement that is no longer to be obtained come from from myself i had explained to her some days previously that the oldest experiences of childhood are no longer to be obtained as such but will be replaced in the analysis by transferences and dreams thus i am the butcher and she refuses to accept these transferences to the present of old ways of thinking and feeling where does her dream utterance i don t know that i won t take it come from for the purposes of the analysis this has to be dissected i don t know that she herself had said to her cook with whom she had a dispute on the previous day but she had then added behave yourself decently here a displacement is palpable of the two sentences which she spoke to her cook she included the insignificant one in her dream but the suppressed sentence behave yourself decently alone fits in with the rest of the dream content one might use the words to a man who was making indecent overtures and had neglected to close his meat shop that we have really hit upon the trail of the interpretation is proved by its agreement with the allusions made by the incident with the greengrocer woman a vegetable which is sold tied up in bundles and is also black what can this be but a dream combination of asparagus and black radish i need not interpret asparagus to the initiated and the other vegetable too seems to me to point to the sexual theme at which we guessed in the beginning when we wanted to replace the story of the dream by the meat shop is closed we are not here concerned with the full meaning of the dream so much is certain that it is full of meaning and by no means guileless ii another guileless dream of the same patient which in some respects is a pendant to the above her husband asks her oughtn t we to have the piano tuned she replies it s not worth while the hammers would have to be rebuffed as well again we have the reproduction of an actual event of the preceding day her husband had asked her such a question and she had answered it in such words but what is the meaning of her dreaming it she says of the piano that it is a disgusting old box which has a bad tone it belonged to her husband before they were married etc but the key to the true solution lies in the phrase it isn t worth while this has its origin in a call paid yesterday to a woman friend she was asked to take off her coat but declined saying thanks it isn t worth while i must go in a moment at this point i recall that yesterday during the analysis she suddenly took hold of her coat of which a button had come undone it was as though she meant to say please don t look in it isn t worth while thus box becomes chest and the interpretation of the dream leads to the years when she was growing out of her childhood when she began to be dissatisfied with her figure it leads us back indeed to earlier periods if we take into consideration the disgusting and the bad tone and remember how often in allusions and in dreams the two small hemispheres of the female body take the place as a substitute and an antithesis of the large ones iii i will interrupt the analysis of this dreamer in order to insert a short innocent dream which was dreamed by a young man he dreamt that he was putting on his winter overcoat again this was terrible the occasion for this dream is apparently the sudden advent of cold weather on more careful examination we note that the two brief fragments of the dream do not fit together very well for what could be terrible about wearing a thick or heavy coat in cold weather unfortunately for the innocency of this dream the first association under analysis yields the recollection that yesterday a lady had confidentially confessed to him that her last child owed its existence to the splitting of a condom he now reconstructs his thoughts in accordance with this suggestion a thin condom is dangerous a thick one is bad the condom is a pullover for it is pulled over something and uebersieher is the german term for a light overcoat an experience like that related by the lady would indeed be terrible for an unmarried man we will now return to our other innocent dreamer iv she puts a candle into a candlestick but the candle is broken so that it does not stand up the girls at school say she is clumsy but she replies that it is not her fault here too there is an actual occasion for the dream the day before she had actually put a candle into a candlestick but this one was not broken an obvious symbolism has here been employed the candle is an object which excites the female genitals its being broken so that it does not stand upright signifies impotence on the man s part but does this young woman carefully brought up and a stranger to all obscenity know of such an application of the candle by chance she is able to tell how she came by this information while paddling a canoe on the rhine a boat passed her which contained some students who were singing rapturously or rather yelling when the queen of sweden behind closed shutters with the candles of apollo she does not hear or else understand the last word her husband was asked to give her the required explanation these verses are then replaced in the dream content by the innocent recollection of a task which she once performed clumsily at her boarding school because of the closed shutters the connection between the theme of masturbation and that of impotence is clear enough apollo in the latent dream content connects this dream with an earlier one in which the virgin pallas figured all this is obviously not innocent v lest it may seem too easy a matter to draw conclusions from dreams concerning the dreamer s real circumstances i add another dream originating with the same person which once more appears innocent i dreamt of doing something she relates which i actually did during the day that is to say i filled a little trunk so full of books that i had difficulty in closing it my dream was just like the actual occurrence here the dreamer herself emphasizes the correspondence between the dream and the reality all such criticisms of the dream and comments on the dream although they have found a place in the waking thoughts properly belong to the latent dream content as further examples will confirm we are told then that what the dream relates has actually occurred during the day it would take us too far afield to show how we arrive at the idea of making use of the english language to help us in the interpretation of this dream suffice it to say that it is again a question of a little box which has been filled so full that nothing can go into it in all these innocent dreams the sexual factor as the motive of the censorship is very prominent but this is a subject of primary significance which we must consider later footnotes cf the psycho pathology of everyday life the tendency of the dream at work to blend everything present of interest into a single transaction has already been noticed by several authors for instance by delage and delboeuf the dream of irma s injection the dream of the friend who is my uncle the dream of the funeral oration delivered by the young physician the dream of the botanical monograph the dreams of my patients during analysis are mostly of this kind cf chap vii on transference havelock ellis a kindly critic of the interpretation of dreams writes in the world of dreams from this point on not many of us will be able to follow f but mr ellis has not undertaken any analyses of dreams and will not believe how unjustifiable it is to judge them by the manifest dream content cf what is said of speech in dreams in the chapter on the dream work only one of the writers on the subject delboeuf seems to have recognized the origin of the speeches heard in dreams he compares them with cliches for the curious i may remark that behind the dream there is hidden a phantasy of indecent sexually provoking conduct on my part and of repulsion on the part of the lady if this interpretation should seem preposterous i would remind the reader of the numerous cases in which physicians have been made the object of such charges by hysterical women with whom the same phantasy has not appeared in a distorted form as a dream but has become undisguisedly conscious and delusional with this dream the patient began her psycho analytical treatment it was only later that i learned that with this dream she repeated the initial trauma in which her neurosis originated and since then i have noticed the same behaviour in other persons who in their childhood were victims of sexual attacks and now as it were wish in their dreams for them to be repeated a substitution by the opposite as will be clear after analysis ,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics are a dense, abstract narrative that seems to delve into the intricacies of dream analysis and psychological reflections, which do not align with the user's prompt about a practical and relatable issue of office etiquette regarding the use of earbuds. The emotional alignment is very poor as the song does not reflect any of the frustration or annoyance expressed in the prompt. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it does not address or relate to the office environment or the specific situation described. The coherence of the lyrics is low; they are complex and difficult to follow, lacking a clear, fluent narrative that connects to the user's situation."

The emotional alignment is low as the song's themes of paranoia and distress do not reflect the simple disgust or surprise at a bad smell. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it discusses themes of delusion and pursuit, which have no connection to the mundane experience of encountering sour milk. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and lack fluency, leading to a low coherence score. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional or contextual needs."

However, it lacks the humorous or light-hearted element of a 'facepalm' moment. Contextually, the song scores a 1 because it does not specifically relate to the scenario of presenting or dealing with a public mistake, focusing instead on a more abstract realization. The lyrical coherence receives a 2, as the lyrics are somewhat cryptic and disjointed, making it difficult to grasp a clear and fluent narrative or message."

However, the song's primary theme of a spiritual journey on the 'J train' diverges significantly from the sports-related context of the user's prompt, resulting in a low contextual relevance score. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and disjointed, which affects their overall coherence, leading to a moderate score in lyrical coherence. Overall, while the song carries an energetic vibe, its thematic focus and lyrical execution do not strongly support the user's specific scenario."
Someone knocked on the door at midnight and then went silent; my heart’s racing.,i found a place in the morning light on strange land at a strange time my heart it cracked like a cherry bomb but i turned my head and i was gone i m ridin on i m ridin on tonight train station million miles down where s someone waiting for me now twelve hours supersonic sleep open my eyes for the colors deep i m ridin on i m ridin on tonight i m ridin on i m ridin on tonight,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of fear and anxiety caused by a mysterious late-night visitor. The song's theme of travel and moving forward ('ridin on tonight') contrasts sharply with the static and tense scenario described in the prompt. The lyrics also lack a direct connection to the theme of a sudden, unsettling interruption at midnight. Lyrical coherence is moderate as the song maintains a consistent narrative about traveling, but it does not clearly convey a strong, coherent story or emotion that matches the prompt. Overall, the song does not effectively mirror the user's emotional and contextual needs."
Got home drenched from the rain and found a thermos of hot tea waiting on my desk—little gestures like that rescue a day.,but meanwhile downstairs i m setting up shop a little too proud to let the matter drop and i can hear you up there isn t it romantic you re huffing and puffing rearranging deck chairs on the titanic and i reach for a glass of cool water drawn from the rivers of babylon and meanwhile outside the stars have come out and the humid summer air pulls at the ring in my snout and you stand at your window looking down and i spread wide my arms jump if you want to jump jump if you want to the water s warm i know i know cause i ve been swimming blindly along through the rivers of babylon,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional and contextual prompt. The user's experience is about finding comfort and warmth in a small, thoughtful gesture, which evokes feelings of gratitude and coziness. The song lyrics, however, depict a scene of conflict and emotional turmoil, with references to 'setting up shop,' 'huffing and puffing,' and 'rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic,' which suggest frustration and futility rather than comfort. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, with a clear narrative flow, but they do not match the warmth and simplicity of the user's scenario. The overall score reflects the poor alignment of the song with the user's emotional state and context."

The emotional alignment is high as the lyrics express the impact of a father's departure and the lingering influence he had, resonating with the user's feelings of nostalgia and loss. Contextually, the song fits the theme of reminiscing about a father, though it introduces elements of conflict among siblings which were not mentioned in the user's prompt, slightly reducing its contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is somewhat lower due to repetitive phrases and a somewhat disjointed narrative that might make it harder for the user to find a clear, consistent message in the song."

This gives it a moderate score in emotional alignment. However, the context of surfing and oceanic themes does not directly relate to the academic achievement of receiving a scholarship, resulting in a lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative structure, leading to a lower score in lyrical coherence."

The user's prompt describes a tender, supportive moment that is emotionally uplifting and personal. The song, however, narrates an energetic and somewhat chaotic day at the races, followed by a physically intimate encounter, which does not reflect the warmth and encouragement described in the prompt. The song's lyrics are somewhat coherent, maintaining a narrative flow, but they do not match the emotional or contextual needs of the user's situation. The overall score is low due to the significant mismatch in both emotional and contextual relevance."

However, the lyrics primarily focus on a journey or escape, which doesn't directly align with the specific context of facing an academic challenge or the confusion of not understanding one's notes. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative, making them moderately coherent but not entirely fluent or impactful in conveying a specific message or emotion."

This earns a high score in emotional alignment. However, the song specifically references Christmas, which may not be contextually relevant unless the user's experience of clearing skies coincidentally aligns with the Christmas season. This results in a lower score for contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive but maintain a coherent message of hope and peace, which is moderately effective in conveying the intended sentiment."

The song's narrative focuses on a melancholic and nostalgic encounter with a past love, which contrasts sharply with the user's celebratory mood. Contextually, the song's setting in a grocery store and themes of past relationships do not relate to the user's experience of professional achievement. The lyrics themselves are coherent and tell a clear story, but they do not match the user's described emotions or context."

The emotional tone of the song seems more introspective and somber, focusing on personal struggles and disillusionment, which does not match the lighter, epiphanic nature of the user's experience. Contextually, the song also misses the mark as it does not address the specific scenario of dealing with technology or a moment of sudden realization. Lyrical coherence is moderate as the lyrics maintain a consistent theme of personal reflection and disillusionment, but they are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making them harder to follow. Overall, the song does not effectively resonate with the user's described emotions or context."

However, the song's context, which seems to delve into themes of disillusionment and critique of societal norms, doesn't directly relate to the user's specific situation concerning pet health. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, presenting a clear narrative about personal realization and societal observations, but they might be perceived as slightly disjointed or abstract in relation to the user's straightforward emotional relief."

However, the context of the song, which seems to revolve around missed connections and personal reminiscences, does not closely match the specific scenario of feeling guilty about laughing at someone's idea in a meeting, leading to a score of 1 for contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and difficult to follow, lacking a clear narrative or fluency, resulting in a coherence score of 2. Overall, the song does not effectively address the user's emotional and contextual needs."
The empty seat at our usual café table made the coffee taste bitter today.,it was a warm summer day watching tv with a flavor ice melting in my hand watching endless summer fifty times or more with my girlfriend and the band we walked down the beach to watch the sun come up drinking a coke she let out a burp so i refilled her cup it s 3am all i hear is my air conditioning getting bored i feel so lame i ll go piss in her coffee cup again she said she s coming back but i know that she s never coming back again,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the emotional tone of the user's prompt, which conveys a sense of loss and melancholy due to an empty seat at a café. The song lyrics, in contrast, describe a casual and somewhat irreverent scene involving summer activities, a relationship, and humorous elements. The emotional alignment is low because the song's mood is significantly lighter and lacks the depth of sadness or reflection suggested by the prompt. Contextually, the mention of a coffee cup in the song is the only slight connection to the café setting in the prompt, but it is used in a very different context, making the relevance minimal. The lyrical coherence of the song is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat fluent but disjointed in narrative, making it difficult to derive a clear, coherent message."
Walked into the living room and everyone yelled “welcome back!”—did not see that coming.,letra de radioactive de imagine dragons bely basarte cover i m waking up to ash and dust i wipe my brow and i sweat my rust i m breathing in the chemicals i m breaking in shaping up then checking out on the prison bus this is it the apocalypse whoa i m waking up i feel it in my bones enough to make my systems blow welcome to the new age to the new age welcome to the new age to the new age whoa whoa i m radioactive radioactive whoa whoa i m radioactive radioactive i raise my flags don my clothes it s a revolution i suppose we re painted red to fit right in whoa i m breaking in shaping up then checking out on the prison bus this is it the apocalypse whoa i m waking up i feel it in my bones enough to make my systems blow welcome to the new age to the new age welcome to the new age to the new age  whoa whoa i m radioactive radioactive whoa whoa i m radioactive radioactive all systems go the sun hasn t died deep in my bones straight from inside i m waking up i feel it in my bones enough to make my systems blow welcome to the new age to the new age welcome to the new age to the new age whoa whoa i m radioactive radioactive whoa whoa i m radioactive radioactive,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,"The song 'Radioactive' by Imagine Dragons, as covered by Bely Basarte, primarily deals with themes of transformation and awakening to a new reality, which might loosely connect to the surprise element of the user's prompt. However, the emotional tone of the song, which is intense and somewhat dark with references to apocalypse and revolution, does not align well with the presumably joyful and light-hearted emotion of being warmly welcomed back by a group. The lyrics themselves are coherent and well-constructed, but they do not fit the specific context of a happy, unexpected welcome. Therefore, the song scores low on emotional and contextual relevance but higher on lyrical coherence."

Emotional alignment scores low as the song's festive, anticipatory emotions do not reflect the awe and pride related to witnessing a personal milestone. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it discusses Christmas and not musical achievements or personal growth. The lyrics, while somewhat coherent in their narrative about Christmas and interactions with Santa Claus, are repetitive and tangentially structured, making them only moderately coherent. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional or contextual needs."

However, the song's theme of hitting the road and feeling small against the vastness of the world doesn't directly relate to the specific context of dealing with lost luggage and airline indifference. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, presenting a clear imagery of movement and emotional turmoil, but they do not directly address the user's situation of dealing with a logistical and customer service problem."

The lyrics directly reference a dripping tap and the inability to turn it off, which perfectly matches the user's context, thus receiving a high score in contextual relevance. However, the lyrical coherence of the song is somewhat low. The lyrics are repetitive and somewhat chaotic, which might reflect the user's frustrated mental state but does not contribute to a clear or fluent narrative. Overall, the song is quite relevant and emotionally aligned with the user's situation, but the coherence of the lyrics could be improved for better overall impact."

However, the emotional depth and context of the song, which deals with significant life challenges and socioeconomic struggles, is far more intense and complex than the simple domestic progress described by the user. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear narrative, but they do not closely match the light-hearted and modest nature of the user's situation. Therefore, while there is a thematic connection in terms of 'progress,' the scale and emotional weight are mismatched, leading to lower scores in emotional and contextual relevance."
Spent half the night checking on my pup’s fever; I’m dead tired but can’t leave his side.,you know i m tired i got a fevered brow you know i d change if i were with her now you gave me drugs you said d cure my ills they may cure yours but mine are with me still if i were with her now if i were with her now if i were with her now,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song's mention of 'tired' and 'fevered brow' aligns well with the user's emotional state of exhaustion and concern due to their dog's fever, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on themes of illness and seeking relief, which is somewhat relevant to the user's situation of caring for a sick pet, though the song's focus on human relationships and personal distress dilutes the direct relevance to the user's context with their pet. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and abstract, impacting the clarity and fluency, hence the average score on lyrical coherence."

The song seems to focus more on personal aspirations and experiences, particularly about reaching new heights and enjoying life's moments, which does not directly relate to the curiosity and wonder about glowing plankton. The emotional alignment is low as the song does not evoke a sense of discovery or learning, which is central to the user's interest in plankton. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it does not mention or metaphorically relate to the ocean, marine life, or scientific curiosity. The lyrical coherence is moderate as the lyrics are somewhat repetitive but maintain a basic fluency and structure."
All morning I’ve been day-dreaming about escaping to a quiet cabin in the woods—can almost smell the pine.,you say forever and i confess i shiver you say hope i say that s where i m goin to be in the shade the oldest trees above my head when i m away i know in my heart there is a heaven if i m out hunting come right on in yeah cause even when i m gone my doors are always open and if i m asleep make sure my blanket covers me yeah when i m away i know in my heart there is a heaven when i m away when i m away when i m away when i m away when i m away when i m away when i m away when i m away when i m away to be in the shade the oldest trees above my head when i m away i know in my heart there is a heaven come right on in yeah come right on in yeah come right on in yeah come right on in yeah,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.3,"The song's lyrics resonate well with the user's emotional state of day-dreaming about escaping to a serene, natural setting, as it mentions being 'in the shade the oldest trees above my head' and a sense of openness and welcoming ('my doors are always open'). This aligns with the user's desire for a quiet cabin in the woods, surrounded by nature. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low due to repetitive phrases and a somewhat disjointed narrative, which might make it harder for the user to fully engage with the song's message. Overall, the song matches well with the emotional and contextual aspects of the prompt but is slightly let down by its lyrical structure."
"Practised for weeks, but the open-mic night was cancelled at the last minute—total letdown.",i was cut open on the way down reeling from the blow and you were there on the other line in between the tears and the lightshow what a disappointment i thought there d be so much more but all this talking is driving me insane and i was told if i was to sing along forget about myself we re all the same well maybe i should change my point of view dizzy in the morning and i m shaking in the afternoon there s never no warning when it s gonna hit and i m like an earthquake when i get thinking too much everything s falling and shaking and falling through my hands well maybe i should change my point of view well all this time we have together it s desperation for everybody it s wishful thinking for the whole human race or whoever 2,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song captures the emotional letdown and disappointment effectively, aligning well with the user's feelings of being let down by the cancellation of the open-mic night. The lyrics express feelings of disillusionment and the impact of unexpected events, which resonates with the user's experience. However, the song's context of personal emotional turmoil and broader existential musings only partially aligns with the specific scenario of preparing for and missing a public performance event. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and abstract, which might make it harder for the user to find a direct narrative coherence, but they still convey a general sense of frustration and confusion that matches the user's emotional state."

However, the context of the song, focusing on media and societal issues, does not closely relate to the specific scenario of people leaving trash in a cinema. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent theme of discontent with external influences, but they do not directly address the user's situation. Overall, the song captures a general sense of frustration but misses the specific context and full emotional resonance with the user's experience."

The lyrics emphasize themes of being in the spotlight, the thrill of the moment, and seizing opportunities ('come on, come on, come on and go and get it'), which aligns well with the emotions of excitement and anticipation. The context of being ready for a big event and the energy of a live performance are also directly relevant to the user's situation. The lyrics are generally coherent and convey a clear message, though the repetitive structure and informal language slightly affect the fluency but maintain the high energy and excitement, fitting the context well."
Walking past that abandoned lot at night makes my pulse race.,and 6 am in morningside the first car rushes by we walk down to the garden and the sunlight fills your eyes and stops me for a moment till i turn and look the other way the windows are all open and it s saturday and where i ride the evening turns to blue and fades away a silence hangs enchanted through sunset and the lane the air is charged with sunlight and your name is ringing through my mind cathedral bells and sunlit is the night,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not effectively align with the user's emotional state of feeling a racing pulse due to walking past an abandoned lot at night, which suggests a feeling of anxiety or fear. The song lyrics, however, depict a serene and peaceful morning scenario, which contrasts starkly with the user's emotion. Contextually, the song also misses the mark as it describes a tranquil, sunlit setting rather than a tense, nighttime environment. The lyrics themselves are fluently written and maintain a coherent flow, but they do not match the user's described emotional or contextual state."

The lyrics emphasize the joy and positivity that can be spread through simple gestures, like a smile or a kind word, aligning well with the user's emotional state. However, the contextual relevance is slightly less direct. While the song speaks to general acts of kindness and their impact, it doesn't specifically address the scenario of someone helping with a physical task like holding a door. The lyrics are coherent and flow well, effectively conveying the message of spreading joy and kindness through everyday actions."

This emotional alignment scores a 4. The contextual relevance scores a 3, as the song mentions enjoying the day, drinking wine, and celebrating, which can be loosely connected to the joy of gardening success but doesn't specifically address the gardening or tomatoes. The lyrical coherence scores a 2 due to the repetitive and somewhat disjointed nature of the lyrics, which may detract from a clear narrative flow. Overall, the song captures the spirit of celebration and joy but lacks specific thematic focus and lyrical clarity."
He doodled a silly sketch of us on the fridge; totally melted my heart.,you looked liked pingu in the igloo your nose was cold you showed me the icicle that you found hanging from the roof i remember your entrance to the room i was in and the half pint glass you were holding that made you look bigger than you were you drew a charming stick man on my left hand and you told me not to wash it off we loved you we loved you,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics capture a tender and playful moment, similar to the user's prompt about a doodle that melted their heart. The emotional alignment is strong, as the lyrics reflect a sense of affection and cherished memories, akin to the feelings evoked by a heartfelt sketch. Contextually, the song mentions a drawing on the hand, which aligns with the idea of a doodle in the prompt, though the setting and specifics differ slightly, leading to a slightly lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat poetic and maintain a coherent narrative about small, loving gestures, which aligns well with the user's emotional state."
Waiting outside the dentist’s room; my knee won’t stop bouncing.,hot blood red you ve got a hold right through my chest alarm let me catch my breath magnetic magnetic i ve waited for hours and now it s time for cake my mouth waters and my teeth ache won t wait any longer magnetic magnetic inside and inside and inside and sin inside and inside and sin and sin,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of anticipation and anxiety with phrases like 'I've waited for hours' and 'let me catch my breath,' which aligns somewhat with the user's nervousness while waiting. However, the mention of 'cake' and 'teeth ache' diverges significantly from the context of waiting at a dentist's office, where typically one would be anxious about a dental procedure rather than anticipating eating. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and disjointed, making it difficult to follow a coherent narrative or theme. Overall, the song does not effectively match the emotional and contextual needs of the user in this specific scenario."
"Got a rejection email, yet somehow I feel the next interview will click.",i might have imagined how things would turn out in stories they always seem to i might have been guilty of thinking one day i d find myself waking up with you but that is not gonna happen while she s still around cause i m the one with everything to lose i ve got my sweet disposition but morgan i might think that i should be the one there next to you i might have been trying to say it out loud in brief conversations with myself and i might have been hoping for reasonable doubt that you might still remember what i can t forget that is not gonna happen while she s still around cause i m the one with everything to lose i ve got my sweet disposition but morgan i might think that i should be the one there next to you i want you i want you it hurts but i want you i know it s a mess but i do oh morgan oh morgan i might be a fool but one of these days i m telling you the truth one of these days i m coming after you oh one of these days i m telling you oh that is not gonna happen while she s still around cause i m the one with everything to lose i ve got my sweet disposition but morgan i might think that i should be the one there next to you think that i should be the one there next to you think that i should be the one there next to you,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song lyrics primarily focus on unrequited love and the longing for someone who is with another person, which does not align well with the user's prompt about handling a job rejection and feeling optimistic about future opportunities. The emotional alignment is low because the song conveys a sense of longing and loss, rather than resilience or hopeful anticipation. Contextually, the song also misses the mark as it deals with personal relationships rather than professional setbacks and aspirations. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent theme and narrative, but they do not clearly support the user's situation or emotional state."
Ran my first 5 k without stopping; pretty pleased with myself.,damn i feel good i might be a little too high girl damn i look good i might be a little too fly yeah i got money in my pocket i got a drink in my hand i feel like nothing can stop me damn i feel like the man i m on top of the world,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics reflect a strong sense of self-satisfaction and confidence, aligning well with the user's emotion of feeling pleased with themselves after running their first 5k. The lyrics 'I feel like nothing can stop me' and 'I'm on top of the world' resonate particularly well with the triumph of achieving a personal milestone. However, the song's context of partying and looking good, indicated by references to being 'too fly' and having 'money in my pocket,' is less relevant to the user's context of completing a physical challenge. The lyrics are coherent and maintain a consistent theme of self-confidence and celebration, though they slightly deviate from the specific context of running."
"Realised the meeting invite said 7 a.m., not p.m.—no wonder no one joined.",i asked you a question but i didn t need you to reply is it gettin heavy but then i realized is it gettin heavy well i thought it was already as heavy as can be is it overwhelming to use a crane to crush a fly it s a good time for superman to lift the sun into the sky cause it s gettin heavy well i thought it was already as heavy as can be tell everybody waitin for superman that they should try to hold on best they can he hasn t dropped them forgot them or anything it s just too heavy for superman to lift is it gettin heavy well i thought it was already as heavy as can be tell everybody waitin for superman that they should try to hold on best they can he hasn t dropped them forgot them or anything it s just too heavy for superman to lift,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song lyrics chosen do not align well with the user's emotional state or the context of the situation. The user's prompt reflects a mix-up and a realization of a mistake, which might invoke feelings of surprise or mild frustration. The song lyrics, however, discuss themes of burden and overwhelming challenges, which are not directly relevant to the user's situation. The lyrics metaphorically use 'Superman' to describe dealing with heavy burdens, which is a stretch from the user's scenario of a simple scheduling error. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear, coherent narrative, making it difficult to draw a strong connection to the user's experience."
The lights flicked back on as soon as the storm ended—felt like exhaling.,and the waves just hang rushing again and just splashing on the rocks sort of sort of a spacial experience that ,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The recommended song lyrics somewhat capture the emotional relief implied in the user's prompt through the imagery of waves rushing and splashing, which can be associated with a sense of release or exhaling after tension. However, the connection is tenuous and not directly aligned with the specific scenario of a storm ending and lights flickering back on. Contextually, the lyrics do not fit well with the theme of a storm or the specific imagery of lights and their effect post-storm. The lyrical coherence is low, as the lyrics are fragmented and lack a clear, fluent narrative or descriptive quality."
"Snapped at my sister for no reason earlier, and it’s eating at me now.",if you listen close and you hear just right a sisters words can chew through a phone line buzz or little boys that cuss because they want to know your name and our lady girl who loved the world but bit a jackrabbit in half on her dying day i heard her say if only they were not so fast so just remember that we are five feet tall and only skin tied to tired bones by veins you re my brother s hands and i m your mother s face but you re only yours to claim you are only yours to claim,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.

The user's prompt reflects a sense of emptiness and transition after putting away holiday decorations, a mood that is reflective and possibly melancholic. The song lyrics, however, discuss themes of drug use, chaotic lifestyles, and disjointed personal experiences, which are starkly different and do not resonate with the user's situation. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent in depicting a specific lifestyle, but they are repetitive and lack a clear narrative structure, which makes them only marginally coherent. Overall, the song does not match the emotional tone or context of the user's prompt."

The song's narrative focuses on suspicion and betrayal in a relationship, which contrasts sharply with the light-hearted and unexpected joy implied in the prompt. The emotional alignment is low because the song conveys suspicion and mistrust, whereas the prompt suggests excitement and surprise. Contextually, the song's theme of relationship issues is irrelevant to the theme of a spontaneous road trip. The lyrical coherence is moderate, as the lyrics are repetitive and somewhat confusing but maintain a consistent story. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."
Watching my sister patiently guide my nephew through his first steps left me amazed by her dedication.,your presence amazes me your glory surrounds me when i walked in this room i felt your arms hands upon me to think how great you are still you would touch someone like me it s your mercy and grace you amaze me i marvel at your greatness incredible your faithfulness to meet you in this unexpected place seems as though i can see you face to face your presence amazes me your glory surrounds me when i walked in this room i felt your arms hands upon me to think how great you are still you would touch someone like me it s your mercy and grace it s your mercy and grace it s your mercy and grace you amaze me,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
I just finished a comedy movie and found myself laughing out loud through the entire end credits.,on my own in the back thought of death made me laugh summer s sun a sinking hole we were young and passionate we were young,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of joy and amusement after watching a comedy movie. The lyrics mentioning 'thought of death' and 'sinking hole' contrast sharply with the light-hearted, cheerful mood described in the prompt. Contextually, the song also does not fit as it seems to evoke a more somber or reflective tone rather than complementing the comedic experience. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear, fluent narrative, making it difficult to grasp a solid theme or story."
"I just returned to my desk and found my meticulously organized files shredded and scattered everywhere, and I was absolutely furious.",fuck this shit i m out mm hmm fuck this shit i m out don t mind me i ma just grab my stuff and leave scuse me please fuck this shit i m out fuck this shit i m out i don t know what the fuck just happened but i don t really care i ma get the fuck up outta here fuck this shit i m out13,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.33,"The song's emotional alignment scores high as it captures the intense frustration and desire to escape a negative situation, mirroring the user's fury upon discovering their destroyed work. However, the contextual relevance is lower because the song's general theme of wanting to leave an unspecified situation only loosely connects with the specific incident of finding one's organized files ruined. The lyrical coherence is low due to the repetitive and simplistic nature of the lyrics, which lack depth and do not form a coherent narrative or detailed expression beyond the immediate reaction of wanting to leave."
The neighbor's car alarm blaring at sunrise grated on my nerves and ruined my morning.,i tried so hard to stay strong the first time i slept alone but the paint was ripped off my front door there was no one to open it though let s talk about it pull me into your darkness there s nothing left to give away nothing left to say today today but the paint got ripped off my front door the paint was ripped off my front door the paint was ripped off my front door,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics chosen do not align well with the user's emotional state of irritation and disruption caused by a car alarm early in the morning. The lyrics focus on a personal emotional struggle and a sense of abandonment, which does not reflect the annoyance and disturbance described in the prompt. Contextually, the mention of a 'front door' being damaged is the closest element related to a home setting, but it does not connect to the specific scenario of a car alarm. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative, making them moderately coherent but not particularly fluent or impactful in this context."

However, the song's focus on religious favor and grace diverges significantly from the secular context of workplace achievement described in the prompt. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but are dense and complex, making them difficult to follow, especially with the rapid shifts in imagery and context. Overall, while there are elements of emotional resonance regarding overcoming challenges, the song's heavy religious overtones and lyrical complexity make it only a moderate match for the user's prompt."
"My brother felt terrible all night, so I stayed by his side and made sure he had everything he needed.",your silhouette is on the door the subtle steps the creaking floor you came to hold me in the dark to soothe the searing pain that sealed this coat of arms you came across my weathered home the walls were blank but still were warm careful with your light now brother i have lost them all see that restless tide now coming down on you alone careful with your light now honey that i fear the most i carried it to bed and now its carrying you home careful with your light now brother i have lost them all see that restless tide now coming down on you alone careful with your light now honey that i fear the most i carried it to bed and now its carrying you home with these peaceful ghosts,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of care and emotional support, aligning well with the user's emotional state of being supportive and attentive to their brother's needs, scoring a 4 in emotional alignment. The context of staying by someone's side and providing comfort is somewhat mirrored in the lyrics, especially with phrases like 'you came to hold me in the dark' and 'careful with your light now brother,' earning a 3 in contextual relevance. The lyrics, while evocative and poetic, can be somewhat cryptic and repetitive, which might make it harder for some listeners to fully grasp or relate to the narrative, resulting in a coherence score of 3. Overall, the song captures the mood of caring and vigilance but could be clearer in its storytelling."
Receiving an urgent call from my doctor asking me to come in immediately without any details left me completely uncertain about what was wrong.,waiting for you to call running to the wall my seat belts on but i still don t feel safe where were you where are you isolated and pretty damn confused don t have many friends so there isn t much to do i know that i m not like all of the rest i have a red heart pumping out my chest,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song captures the emotion of uncertainty and anxiety well, as reflected in the lyrics 'waiting for you to call' and 'isolated and pretty damn confused', which aligns with the user's feelings of uncertainty after receiving an urgent, ambiguous call from the doctor. The mention of feeling unsafe despite precautions ('my seat belts on but i still don t feel safe') also mirrors the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song touches on themes of waiting and confusion, which are relevant to the user's situation. However, the lyrics also diverge into themes of loneliness and self-identity ('don't have many friends', 'I have a red heart pumping out my chest') which, while emotionally resonant, are not directly relevant to the user's immediate context of a medical concern. The lyrical coherence is strong, with a clear expression of emotions and a consistent narrative, though the flow and structure could be slightly more polished."
I just uncovered a major secret hidden in the archives and can’t stop wondering what else I’ll find.,well i was ready to walk into your heart i ll make believe there s something i ve lost but i think you know what i ve done oh i think you know i ll be your surprise it s just a secret that s alwasy on display or just a memory you can t throw away oh i ll be your surprise,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song's lyrics partially align with the emotion of uncovering secrets, particularly with phrases like 'I think you know what I've done' and 'it's just a secret that's always on display.' This suggests a sense of hidden truths being subtly revealed, which resonates with the user's feeling of discovering something significant. However, the song's focus on personal relationships and emotional surprises dilutes its contextual relevance to the specific scenario of uncovering historical or archival secrets. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative flow, reducing their coherence and making it harder to draw a direct connection to the user's experience of uncovering archival secrets."

The song mentions various activities and locations, but none relate to cooking or the specific culinary experience the user is interested in. The emotional tone of the song seems more focused on adventure and casual fun, which does not match the focused and possibly sophisticated task of making a chocolate soufflé. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, but they jump from one scenario to another, which might make it difficult for the listener to follow a clear narrative or theme. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."
"I opened the email to see that tonight’s concert had been canceled, leaving me utterly let down.",well i got caught in traffic and it made me miss my flight my flight and they aren t gonna have another one till tomorrow night that s right i m runnin for the train cuz i m late for work again oh no and the door slam shut just before i can get in i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it i was born too late so i never got to see jimmy hendrix he s dead i was born too late so i never got to meet sid vicious he s dead i was born too late so i never got to see ziggy stardust oh no i was born too late so i never got to see t rex i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it i missed a ride i missed a plane i missed a light i missed a train missed my sister missed my period missed my mother missed my father missed my boyfriend missed my girlfriend i missed my period because i missed it missed it because i missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it born too late born too late ,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a series of frustrations and missed opportunities, which aligns well with the user's feeling of being let down due to the concert cancellation. This earns a high score in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song relates to missing events and opportunities, somewhat similar to missing a concert, thus it has moderate relevance. However, the lyrical coherence is lower due to the repetitive nature and somewhat disjointed listing of missed opportunities without deeper exploration or resolution, which might not fully resonate with the user's specific situation of a canceled concert."
"I just found out the community center canceled the free cooking classes without telling me, and it felt unfair that they didn’t ask for my opinion.",i remember the days that were so far gone you don t seem to feel the way i do it sucks cause when we ve gotta leave this place we re gonna miss it crazy you don t even know that you ve been distant so i made a quick decision with friends all by the door you stood there in the kitchen with your eyes fixed on the floor the logical solution you d ignore you always wanted more than this there wasn t a turning point that i could think of it was just another day where we all linked up now it s clear what s happening and i m so bummed out wasting all my energy so you might calm down but you make the same decisions and you left us at the door you re sitting in the kitchen with your eyes fixed on the floor the logical solution you d ignore you always wanted more than this,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song lyrics reflect a general sense of disappointment and feeling of being let down, which aligns somewhat with the user's emotion of feeling unfairly treated. However, the specifics of the song, which seem to revolve around personal relationships and a more intimate betrayal, do not align well with the context of a community center canceling classes. The lyrics themselves are moderately coherent, maintaining a narrative about disappointment and unmet expectations, but they do not directly address the user's situation regarding a lack of communication and involvement in decisions. Overall, the song partially captures the user's emotional state but lacks contextual relevance to the specific situation of canceled classes."
"I just took a bite of my sandwich and realized it had gone bad, making my stomach turn.",it was over and i felt a hand run over my head and the wind came and it brought me to the surface of the sand and i realize that you are here to help me understand i have a brother they were after us the walls are gone the pipes are hanging all the money left and you were lost and we were hiding so i take this time a time to breathe for all the days they re gone to find another only this now only this now spit at the sea we move to something new only when we want to alone on the sea that mothered me,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of disgust and discomfort caused by eating spoiled food. The song's lyrics seem to explore themes of loss, survival, and perhaps a journey or transformation, which do not relate to the specific context of food spoilage and the resultant physical discomfort. Additionally, the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making it difficult to derive a clear and coherent narrative or emotional thread that connects directly to the user's experience."
I just waved enthusiastically at someone who wasn’t waving at me and wanted to disappear on the spot.,hang that wreath so i can have a happy new year you re so pretty people envy you can you tie a tie you re the reason children turn to dope pour my drink so we can have ourselves a good time you re the reason people lose their minds when they re all around you and you don t know what you ve done,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song lyrics chosen do not align well with the user's emotional state of embarrassment and a desire to disappear. The lyrics seem to focus more on admiration and the negative impacts of someone's presence, which does not reflect the user's feeling of awkwardness or embarrassment. Contextually, the song also does not match the specific situation of misinterpreting a social cue. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear, consistent narrative, making it difficult to grasp a solid theme or message. Overall, the song does not effectively address or resonate with the user's described emotional and contextual needs."
I just found out my best friend is flying in for a surprise visit and I can’t stop smiling.,i got a big surprise when i saw you smile i never dreamed that it could be but now i realize since i saw you smile there s only happiness for me so bye bye blues bye bye blues bells ring birds sing sun is shining no more pining just we two smiling thru don t sigh don t cry bye bye blues blues,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The song's lyrics perfectly capture the emotion of happiness and surprise, aligning well with the user's feelings about their friend's unexpected visit. The repeated references to smiling and joy reflect the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song fits the theme of a joyful reunion, although it doesn't specifically mention a friend or a visit, which slightly lowers its contextual score. The lyrics are coherent and follow a clear, positive narrative about letting go of sadness and embracing joy, though the repetitive structure might affect the depth of the narrative slightly."
"I just got word my friend is driving here through this raging thunderstorm, and each crack of thunder sent a chill down my spine.",clang clang clang went the trolley ding ding ding went the bell zing zing zing went my heartstrings for the moment i saw him i fell chug chug chug went the motor bump bump bump went the brake thump thump thump went my heartstrings when he smiled i could feel the car shake he tipped his hat and took a seat he said he hoped he hadn t stepped upon my feet he asked my name i held my breath i couldn t speak because he scared me half to death buzz buzz buzz went the buzzer plop plop plop went the wheels stop stop stop went my heartstrings as he started to leave i took hold of his sleeve with my hand and as if it were planned he stayed on with me and it was grand just to stand with his hand holding mine all the way to the end of the line,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.5,"The recommended song, with its playful and light-hearted depiction of a romantic encounter on a trolley, does not align well with the user's emotional state of anxiety and concern for a friend driving through a dangerous storm. The emotional alignment is low because the song's cheerful tone contrasts sharply with the user's worry. Contextually, the song's focus on a romantic meeting in a trolley is irrelevant to the scenario of a friend driving in a storm, leading to a low contextual relevance score. The lyrics themselves, while whimsical and rhythmic, are coherent in their storytelling, thus receiving a moderate score for lyrical coherence. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."
"I came home after a long day to find my partner had cleaned up and cooked dinner, and it made me realize how lucky I am to have them.",last night we brought the children by to visit their grandpa and it s plain to see they re truly part of him while we were there their grandma took out some old photographs man he sure looked a lot like me back then i m seein my father in me i guess that s how it s meant to be and i find i m more and more like him each day i notice i walk the way he walks i notice i talk the way he talks i m startin to see my father in me and today i took my wife for a walk down that old dirt road where my daddy took my mom so many times and we found the time to mention things we never had before and we shared some thoughts about the family life yeah i m seein my father in me i guess that s how it s meant to be and i find i m more and more like him each day i notice i walk the way he walks i notice i talk the way he talks i m startin to see my father in me and now lookin back i can recall the times we disagreed when i could not take hold of his old fashioned ways and the more i tried to prove him wrong the more i proved him right now i know why he still stood by me when i went through that stage i m seein my father in me i guess that s how it s meant to be and i find i m more and more like him each day i notice i walk the way he walks i notice i talk the way he talks i m startin to see my father in me and i m happy to see my father in me,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,"The recommended song primarily focuses on a person reflecting on their similarities with their father and the generational passage of traits and values, which does not directly align with the user's prompt about appreciating their partner's thoughtful actions after a long day. Emotional alignment is low because the song's theme of familial legacy and resemblance does not mirror the user's feelings of gratitude and love towards a partner. Contextual relevance is also low as the song discusses family history and father-child relationships rather than a romantic partnership. However, the lyrical coherence of the song is quite high, as the lyrics are clear, fluent, and tell a consistent story about familial connections and self-realization."
"I just found my grandmother’s favorite shawl tucked in her chair, and tears welled up as I remembered her warmth.",there s a blanket of snow covering up the old road to the house where i was raised through the window i see the lights on the tree and a glow from the old fireplace though it all looks the same so much as changed from the way it used to be christmas memories of happy years gone by they come back to me and keep me warm inside still those memories make me cry now the stockings are filled the old house is still and the kids are all dreaming away there s that old easy chair me and daddy sat there waiting for santa s sleigh now daddy has gone but we ll carry on cause the little ones still need christmas memories of happy years gone by they come back to me and keep me warm inside still those christmas memories oh they mean so much to me oh those christmas memories make me cry,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong emotional resonance with the user's prompt, particularly in the themes of nostalgia, memory, and loss. The emotional alignment is high as both the prompt and the song deal with reminiscing about past family experiences and the warmth they provided, which is now missed. The contextual relevance is moderately high but not perfect, as the song specifically centers around Christmas memories, which may not directly relate to the user's memory of their grandmother unless it is tied to that holiday. The lyrics are coherent and fluently convey the sentiment of cherishing past memories while feeling the pain of loss, which aligns well with the user's emotional state."
"I opened my inbox this morning to find I’d received my scholarship award, and I can’t stop grinning from ear to ear.",i think i saw ol santa through my window christmas eve my eyes were really droopy but i really do believe it must ve been ol santa cause i saw his big red hat and i know my mom and dad can t fly like that oh no and then i heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door the same ol christmas trick my dad had played since i was four he stands outside my bedroom yelling ho ho ho because he knows i don t believe in santa claus no way i think my daddy sees me peeking from my door but he pretends he s santa anyway every year he tries to fool me but i m a big boy now i don t believe in santa or his sleigh no way so i went back to my bed and i curled up nice and tight i stared out of my window and i looked into the night and then all of a sudden through my window i could see santa claus was flying by and smiling at me santa claus santa claus it must ve been ol santa claus santa claus santa claus happy ho ho ho to you and then i heard ol rudolph tellin me to come outside he told me that ol santa wanted me to take a ride i climbed out of my window and i jumped onto his sleigh and then ol santa took me up and away  we flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below i saw my big red school house and the town square picture show it was really past my bedtime and so ol santa said little boys like you should be in bed so i hollered ho ho ho and i put on santa s hat then he let me hold the reins a while we pulled up to my window and i jumped back in my room and i waved goodbye to santa with a smile when i woke up christmas morning well it was clear and bright my parents said my window had blown open in the night i smiled as i told them that it must ve been the cat and they asked me where i got my big red hat yeah yeah c mon santa claus santa claus it must ve been ol santa claus santa claus santa claus happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you one more again,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song is a Christmas-themed narrative about a child's interaction with Santa Claus, which does not align with the user's emotion of joy and achievement from receiving a scholarship award. The emotional alignment and contextual relevance scores are both 0, as the song's theme of Christmas and childhood fantasy does not match the user's situation of academic achievement and personal success. The lyrical coherence score is 3, as the lyrics are fluent and tell a clear, albeit unrelated, story. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual prompt, resulting in a low overall score."
"I woke up this morning to find a bouquet of flowers on my nightstand with a note that said ‘just because’, and my heart melted.",at this point in my life clearly i can see all the gifts he bestowed upon me that is why deep inside i have this joy there was once a time my soul was searching to find a place to nest now in this joy i can rest now my heart holds the love he has given me and that s all that i ll ever need to live believe and spread his love i m so glad i have this joy,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a deep sense of joy and gratitude, which aligns well with the user's emotional state of feeling touched and loved upon receiving a surprise bouquet. The mention of gifts and joy resonates with the emotional warmth described in the prompt. However, the song's context seems to be more spiritually oriented, focusing on divine gifts and love, which slightly diverges from the romantic or personal gesture described in the prompt. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express feelings of contentment and spiritual fulfillment, though they may not perfectly match the specific scenario of receiving flowers from a loved one."
"I just sat down to record my podcast and realized I hadn’t rehearsed my opening lines, and I felt my palms grow clammy.",i realised my fists were clenched i stretched my fingers to relax still not sleeping i tried counting sheep one by one they leapt across the fence constructed for them right to left across the fence i had constructed having jumped they refused further direction each sheep where it landed refusing to exit remained try as i might i could not stop them entering once again try as they might not one could leave the stage i realised my fists were clenched i stretched my fingers each sheep were it landed refusing to exit remained try as they might not one could leave the stage try as i might i could not stop them entering once again no longer daring to close my eyes still not sleeping i realised my goose was cooked i wandered shipshaped on the shore,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The song lyrics depict a sense of anxiety and restlessness, which partially aligns with the user's feeling of nervousness (emotional alignment score of 2). However, the context of the song, focusing on sleeplessness and an inability to control thoughts, diverges significantly from the user's specific scenario of unpreparedness for a podcast recording (contextual relevance score of 1). The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, lacking a clear narrative or fluency, which makes them difficult to follow (lyrical coherence score of 1). Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional state and context, resulting in a low overall score."
I just watched the sunrise break through the clouds and felt sure today would bring new opportunities.,as i aimlessly wander around how could i ever expect to be found until looking down and seeing the light at the ground by my feet i heard angels resound and there i avowed this is the road i would take just to make it there for my sake now i say that i ll never break chorus i can get there by the light at my feet you ve made me walk in electricity i can get there by the light at my feet you are my everything all that i need now that i see it s so easy for me to proceed on to my destiny and let it be seen the light that you ve given thee let it be efficiently electricity you can take me there,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of hope and direction, aligning well with the user's emotional state of feeling optimistic about new opportunities after witnessing a sunrise. The metaphor of light and guidance in the lyrics ('light at my feet', 'electricity') resonates with the imagery of a sunrise breaking through clouds, making it contextually relevant. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, though the flow and structure can be slightly confusing, impacting the overall clarity of the message. Overall, the song matches well with the user's emotional and contextual prompt, despite some lyrical ambiguity."
I just saw my project showcased in the company newsletter and couldn’t help but beam at what I’d accomplished.,i woke about nine opened up my eyes figured it s time to rise threw the curtains open wide and peeped outside yo the weather was fine i knew that was a sign that today would be a good day i popped a cd on jumped in the shower sploshed and washed till i m fresh like a flower next grab a towel and i dry myself off i grab my vest cos next it s time to get dressed i rocked white socks my fubu boxers clean white jeans and this mean white top wot zips down the side of my neck to my left shoulder blade feel like i just got paid today yeah brushed my teeth and my hair then i popped my contacts in and binned the containers put on my trainers out the front door waves hi to the neighbours oh what a glorious thing waking up in the morning baby oh what a glorious thing get to have a whole day hey so i hop on my stolen bike and ride down the kingsland road bouncing over speed bumps calves pump pedals the way i ramp that plank i desrve a frigging medal petrol fumes looms as my bike zooms stuck behind a bus wot s rough so i cough which reminds me when the sun s blistering i m gonna have to take an anti histamine or else i ll get stressed again sneeze so hard i split my vest again vex my chest till i m depressed again no way pos sis so i drop by the office check out my emails females blowing up my inbox boom soon though i m off again headed down park hook up with my peeps we kick ball till its dark then we re off to rock a show and i m super glad it s stunners time kicking dope rhymes in the summertime word,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song captures a positive and upbeat emotion, aligning well with the user's feeling of pride and accomplishment, hence a score of 4 for emotional alignment. However, the context of the song, which revolves around a casual day of personal activities and social interactions, only partially matches the user's professional achievement context, leading to a score of 2 for contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat coherent with a clear narrative flow, though the casual and slang-heavy language might detract from the clarity for some listeners, resulting in a coherence score of 3. Overall, the song has a positive vibe but doesn't fully encapsulate the professional context of the user's achievement."
"I just found an old photo of my childhood home tucked away in a drawer, and it made me realize how far I’ve come.",old friends bookends solitaire for two til she was leaving i never really knew when i looked in her eyes i realized it was all when i looked in her eyes i realized there s a knock on the door then you re home forever more and now that you re here there is nothing to fear when i looked in her eyes i realized ,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the emotional and contextual elements of the user's prompt. The user's prompt reflects a nostalgic and reflective emotion, focusing on personal growth and the passage of time, triggered by finding an old photo of a childhood home. The song lyrics, however, seem to center around a relationship and the emotions experienced upon reuniting with someone, which does not directly relate to the themes of nostalgia or personal growth. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but lack a clear narrative or connection to the user's emotional state. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional journey or the context provided in the prompt."
"I just got the call that my test results came back clear, and I felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders.",let me down now i m falling off the line and i can feel it crawling through my spine because in my room now i feel so divine not a worry running through my mind,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics chosen reflect a sense of relief and liberation, which aligns well with the user's emotional state after receiving good news about their test results. The mention of feeling 'so divine' and having 'not a worry running through my mind' resonates with the user's description of feeling a 'huge weight lift off their shoulders.' However, the contextual relevance is slightly lower as the lyrics also mention 'falling off the line' and feeling something 'crawling through my spine,' which could imply a sense of unease or discomfort, not entirely fitting the context of receiving positive news. The lyrical coherence is strong, with a clear expression of emotions and a smooth flow, though the connection between all the elements could be slightly clearer to perfectly match the user's situation."
I just reread the harsh message I sent my friend last night and felt a deep regret for how I spoke.,i apologize to all persons that i have hurt in the past i m sorry so sorry i m sorry so sorry please accept my apology damn son you getting tight i ain t mean it it was a joke damn you you you can t take a joke c mon man you know what i m sorry i ain t the hero that you need in your life i m sorry but sometimes i tend to live trife i m sorry i can t say what you want me to say i m sorry i m bound to flip up on any given day i m sorry y all seem conceeded but i know my shit s fly i m sorry i lost my temper and punched you in the eye i m sorry i can t live up to your expectations i m sorry if how i move causes you frustration i m sorry that a brother have all type of hang ups i m sorry i quit smoking cause now i drink too much i m sorry i make mistakes that i can t take back like busting guns and selling crack i m sorry to all the cats that i hit in the head i m sorry i get violent when i get real fed i m sorry i couldn t be a better friend but i do the right thing if i could do it again i m sorry i couldn t be there when you needed help i m sorry but i was busy tryin to help myself i m sorry that life is filled with all type of hard knocks but if you can t handle it then kick rocks i m sorry so sorry i m sorry so sorry  i m sorry if you think that i m a dirty such such i m sorry i got a big mouth and talk too much i m sorry my first album couldn t save the world and if at any point in life i hit your girl i m sorry if sometimes i m contradictory i m sorry mcs try hard but they can t see me i m sorry i don t work with your favourite producer i m sorry i can t quit cause i m not a loser i m sorry but i have to walk with my head high i m sorry my mind state is not just getting by i m sorry for things i said cause i know i offend i m sorry but i call it like i see it my friend i m sorry if we met and you thought i was rude but i make it a habit not to hang with dudes i m sorry if i generically signed you autograph i m sorry if you feel i ain t bring the heat since the wrath i m sorry if i ignored you tryin to spit to some chick i m sorry but sometimes i think with my dick i m sorry for knowing the godly but dealing with earth this is a formal apology for what it s worth i m sorry but life is filled with all type of hard knocks and if you can t handle it pssst kick rocks i m sorry so sorry i m sorry so sorry please accept my apology is that good enough you feel better now listen i m sorry i m not the man that you want me to be i m sorry i don t understand you and you can t understand me i m sorry for all the feelings that i hurt in the past if you thought it was gonna be more than me tapping that ass i m sorry if we kicked it and we got too close i can t deal with commitment so i m sorry i m ghost i m sorry i got honeys all over the place i m sorry that i learned to lie with a poker face i m sorry to all the chicks that i gassed on tour told em i keep in touch but i don t see them no more i m sorry we was involved and you got your heart broken i m sorry it went down like that i ain t joking i m sorry it had to be that way i m sorry for all the games i felt i had to play i m sorry if i was grimy and i hit your friend and even though i m sorry i d probably do it again i m sorry sometimes i only think of myself i m sorry i ain t warned you before we dealt i m sorry shortee said i was her favourite rapper i m sorry i had no self control and had to tap her i m sorry life is filled with all type of hard knocks and if you can t handle it shortee kick rocks,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song's repeated apologies and expressions of regret align somewhat with the user's feelings of remorse, scoring a 3 in emotional alignment. However, the context in which the apologies are delivered—often flippant or insincere, and involving scenarios far removed from the user's situation—lowers its contextual relevance to a 2. The lyrics, while fluent, often veer off into tangents that are not directly related to a sincere apology, which affects their coherence, also scored at 2. Overall, while the theme of apology is present, the tone and content may not fully resonate with the user's specific emotional and contextual needs."
"I just sat down for dinner and saw my father’s chair still empty, my heart ached and I can’t stop crying.",drinkin jameson thinking about what we could have had cause you know that nothing seems to help everything just makes me so damn sad i don t want to be anywhere else that i could be right now i ve made my bed with the things i ve said so now i ll go lay down i miss you but it s just part of our lives to miss the things we never had ,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a deep sense of loss and longing, aligning well with the user's emotional state of heartache and sadness due to the absence of their father. The mention of missing 'the things we never had' resonates with the user's feeling of loss, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song's theme of reminiscing and dealing with absence fits the situation of an empty chair at a family dinner, though it does not specifically address the familial or father-child relationship, which slightly lowers its contextual relevance score. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express the emotions of sadness and missing someone, which makes the lyrical coherence score high. Overall, the song captures the mood of the situation but could be more specifically tailored to the familial context to enhance its relevance."
"I just discovered a heartfelt letter from my childhood friend tucked inside an old book, and I was completely caught off guard.",long ago and oh so far away there were dreams that i recall full of unicorns who loved to play behind my garden walls and the clouds would look like dragons tails as they moved across the sky and a tree could be the prince of whales and little girls could fly i remember every moment how it was to just be me and to my surprise i look through your eyes and once more i can see i remember living in between what was real and what was not neath a sky of blue and a field of green i long ago forgot i remember rabbits running late underneath my mothers fence and a singing cup and a talking plate who somehow both made sense i remember every moment i remember being free and to my surprise i look through your eyes and i remember me for somewhere deep inside me there s a girl from way back when she just needs your heart to guide me and make her see again i remember every moment how it was to just be me and to my surprise i look through your eyes and once more i can see,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.3,"The recommended song lyrics resonate well with the emotional and contextual aspects of the user's prompt. The lyrics evoke a sense of nostalgia and rediscovery, similar to the emotions likely stirred by finding a childhood friend's letter. The mention of memories, childhood fantasies, and a return to a past self align closely with the emotional journey of revisiting old, cherished memories, as described in the user's experience. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express a narrative of recalling and reconnecting with one's past, which mirrors the user's situation of reconnecting with a childhood memory through the letter. The overall score reflects a strong alignment in terms of emotional resonance, contextual relevance, and lyrical coherence with the user's described scenario."
I really look up to my brother. I hope I can be like him one day.,i ve waited for this day for such a long time you are everything i ve waited for if memory says i might be disappointed cause a lifetime here with you will seem to short all i see is white that s coming towards me all i ve wanted you within my arms if it s required that i forsake all others i ll do that and more i ve waited for this day for such a long time i hope that i can be what you deserve i hope the days get longer and make this love grow stronger god will be the strength and our reason,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.7,"The song lyrics express a strong sense of anticipation and dedication, which aligns somewhat with the user's admiration for their brother and desire to emulate him, scoring a 3 in emotional alignment. However, the song seems to focus more on a romantic or deeply personal relationship rather than the fraternal, aspirational context indicated by the user, resulting in a contextual relevance score of 2. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, with a clear expression of commitment and longing, but they lack a direct connection to the theme of brotherly admiration, leading to a coherence score of 3. Overall, while the song captures general themes of dedication and hope, it doesn't specifically address the user's admiration for a sibling, leading to an overall score of 2.7."
I watched this concert today and couldn’t stop laughing and smiling. It just made me feel so light and entertained.,let s sit here in the breakdown lane let s ohh and ahh until the show stops the way it makes your face light up let s have a show of hands who s enjoying themselves i know i am,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,"The recommended song lyrics align well with the user's emotional state of feeling light and entertained, as reflected in the phrases 'the way it makes your face light up' and 'who's enjoying themselves I know I am.' These lyrics capture the joy and engagement the user felt during the concert. However, the contextual relevance is slightly lower because the lyrics mention sitting in a 'breakdown lane,' which doesn't directly relate to attending a concert. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative flow, which might make them less impactful in fully capturing the user's concert experience."
I’m honestly so mad right now. I trusted someone again and they hurt me—how can people keep doing this?,don t you dare to play with my feelings i can t take it any more you spin my world around you turned me upside down i tried to stay far away from you far away from you why do you still try when you are the one to blame why do i still cry it will never be the same why do you still try when you are the one to blame why do i still cry it ll never be the same you are begging me to stay with you but you are driving me insane get out of my way and i will walk alone i don t wanna be part of your game i don t wanna be part of your game why do you still try when you are the one to blame why do i still cry it will never be the same why do you still try when you are the one to blame why do i still cry it ll never be the same ,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song perfectly captures the emotion of anger and betrayal expressed in the user's prompt. The lyrics directly address feelings of being hurt by someone trusted, which aligns well with the user's situation. The theme of the song about being manipulated and deciding to walk away resonates strongly with the context of being repeatedly hurt by someone. The lyrics are mostly coherent, maintaining a clear narrative about confronting and rejecting someone who has caused emotional pain, though some repetitive lines slightly affect the fluency."
"There’s this person I deal with regularly, and the way he speaks just really irritates me. I don’t know why it gets to me so much.",i m so frustrated some things are making me so sick inside aw go with your heart go with your heart yeah right quit tugging me aw i m just not good enough for you let s change let s be something we re not let s be something everybody else is ah so much built up inside it s fucking ridiculous i don t know if i should freak the fuck out on you or just sit back and laugh you want more you don t have anything me me i have everything yeah i have everything what more could i ask for nothing at all why did it have to be this way at the end why did it have to be this way at the end 1,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song captures the frustration and irritation expressed in the user's prompt, aligning well emotionally. The context of dealing with a difficult person is somewhat reflected in the song's narrative of conflict and emotional turmoil, though it's more intense and confrontational than the user's description of irritation due to someone's speech. The lyrics, while expressive, are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, which affects their coherence and might make it harder for the user to fully relate to or understand the song's message."
Someone at work has been handling things incredibly well. I just wanted to say I genuinely respect how he manages everything.,he is a mighty good god for him there s nothing to hard there is no problem he can t solve he is the lord of all in him i find no fault in him there is no failure in him i will not lack he is the lord of all in you i find no fault in you there is no failure in you i will not lack you are the lord of all you are the lord of all yes you are yes you are you are the lord of all ,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's lyrics focus on praising and acknowledging the omnipotence and perfection of a divine figure, which loosely aligns with the user's intent to express respect and admiration for a colleague's management skills. However, the emotional alignment is moderate (scored 2) because the song's religious overtones and context do not precisely reflect the secular nature of workplace admiration. Contextually, the song is not very relevant (scored 1) as it addresses divine perfection rather than human managerial skills. The lyrics are somewhat coherent (scored 3), maintaining a consistent theme of faultlessness and support, but they lack direct applicability to the user's workplace scenario."
"I’ve been taking care of a little bunny for a couple of years, and I feel so responsible for his well-being. He means a lot to me.",you know that i care what happens to you and i know that you care for me so i don t feel alone or the weight of the stone now that i ve found somewhere safe to bury my bone and any fool knows a dog needs a home a shelter from pigs on the wing,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of care and responsibility, aligning somewhat with the user's emotional state regarding their attachment and responsibility towards their pet bunny. However, the song specifically references a dog, which reduces its contextual relevance to the user's situation with a bunny. The lyrics are coherent and convey a clear message about needing a safe place and the mutual care between the speaker and the subject, which can metaphorically relate to any pet, including the user's bunny. The overall score reflects a moderate match, acknowledging the emotional resonance but recognizing the mismatch in the specific pet context."
I just got here and I feel completely disoriented. I don’t understand what’s going on or what I’m supposed to be doing.,well i don t know how you do this when the path were on is misleading us home well i don t know what to do kid the sun is out and i feel alive like i haven t in a long time looking backs been getting me down i m writing this for old friends that i miss to start and end things the right way gather up while i feel alive like i haven t in a long time is this a lesson in being more careful or is this a lesson in telling the truth i mapped it all out i mapped our lives out i woke up this morning and the circles were drifting apart,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.7,"The song captures a sense of disorientation and confusion, aligning somewhat with the user's emotional state of feeling lost and unsure. The lyrics express uncertainty and a struggle to find direction, which resonates with the user's feelings. However, the song also introduces themes of feeling alive and reconnecting with old friends, which might not directly relate to the user's immediate context of being new and disoriented in an unfamiliar situation. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, though they jump between different thoughts and feelings, which might mirror the user's disoriented state but could also add to the confusion rather than providing clarity or comfort."
Lately I’ve had this urge to dive into new topics and ideas—I just feel intrigued about everything around me.,doesn t matter any of it happened before maybe it was locked but you still opened the door the kind that got nailed up mind in the store so you held yo head down mopping the floor if you were gonna wreck it next to what was it for i guess it doesn t matter much not anymore if that s what you wanna do till you make the best of you cause i m getting used to you i did what i had to do we wanna get from you if you are feeling alone gonna open up the lines and stay by the phone cause maybe this loneliness is bred in the bone anyone with half of a mind would probably had known it s like when looking down from this spectacular drone whispering secrets into megaphones i want more than ever before i want way beyond satisfaction in this case you know the less isn t more and i can t wait to see your reaction i can t wait to see your reaction yeah i can t wait i m supposed your memory is not as before you might have got your head caught slammed in the door either way your memory is not as before guess that i could give the benefit of the doubt if i wouldn t know just what you is about don t have to be a genius to figure it out ,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song lyrics partially align with the user's emotional state of feeling intrigued and eager to explore new ideas, as indicated by phrases like 'I want more than ever before' and 'I want way beyond satisfaction.' However, the song's overall theme seems to delve more into personal relationships and introspection rather than the excitement of learning or discovery, which affects its contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is low, with disjointed thoughts and a lack of clear narrative flow, making it difficult to fully grasp the message or connect it effectively to the user's prompt."
"More than anything right now, I just want to grow and improve. I want to become someone I can be proud of.",we can pretend who we can be a dancer in a top hat or a captain of the sea i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song's lyrics resonate well with the user's desire for personal growth and self-acceptance, scoring high in emotional alignment. The repeated lines 'I just want to be myself for everyone to see' echo the user's aspiration to become someone they can be proud of, emphasizing authenticity and self-expression. However, the contextual relevance is moderate as the lyrics also introduce themes of pretending to be different characters, which slightly diverges from the user's focus on genuine self-improvement. The lyrical coherence is average; the lyrics are simple and repetitive, which aids memorability but lacks depth and complexity that might enrich the user's emotional journey."
"I thought I could rely on someone close to me, but they let me down again. It hurts more than I expected.",i ve been so long without you i try not to think about you but i do i know that i m to blame i got no right to call your name but i do i do i m so hurt to think that you d lie to me i m hurt way down deep inside of me,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics align well with the user's emotional state of feeling hurt and let down by someone close, which is reflected in lines like 'I'm so hurt to think that you'd lie to me.' This shows a strong emotional alignment. Contextually, the song fits as it discusses feelings of betrayal and disappointment, though it leans more towards a romantic angle which might not perfectly match the user's situation if their disappointment isn't romantic in nature. The lyrics are coherent and express a clear narrative of hurt and betrayal, making them easy to understand and relate to."
"I tried to accept things the way they are, but I can’t anymore. I don’t agree with what’s happening, and I think I need to walk away.",i m breaking out these walls can t hold me any longer days pass me by and i got stronger with every breath i ever took i doubted this world as a whole i refuse to live in a world that refuses me i refuse to live a life that isn t right for me i refuse i m breaking out when reality comes i ll shove it away and try to make it to another day i refuse,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
I was asked to do something today that almost made me puke. I couldn’t even pretend to be okay with it.,vomit in the ball pit step right in and drown in it i saw it when i was a little kid it fucked me up and made me sick so i said auuuuuuugh auuuuuuugh and late at night i still smell it the stench of rancid clown vomit so i went to see a therapist he said face your fear and shit on it so i said auuuuuuugh auuuuuuugh auuuuuuugh auuuuuuugh vomit in the ball pit step right up and take a shit i pinched the loaf that cured my head but now my ass is burning red so i said auuuuuuugh auuuuuuugh auuuuuuugh auuuuuuugh,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.33,"The song's lyrics strongly align with the user's feeling of disgust and revulsion, as both the prompt and the song involve a visceral reaction to an unpleasant situation, scoring high on emotional alignment. However, the song's context of a literal 'vomit in the ball pit' only partially matches the metaphorical disgust expressed in the user's prompt, leading to a moderate score in contextual relevance. The lyrics' repetitive and somewhat nonsensical nature, focusing heavily on crude expressions and lacking a clear, coherent narrative, results in a low score for lyrical coherence. Overall, while the song captures the emotional essence, its relevance and coherence are limited."
I told someone I liked them and their friends laughed at me. Now I can’t stop feeling ashamed.,shame shame shame ooooh i i i i shame shame shame i haven t felt this way since i was seventeen you know what i mean guilty of love in the first degree baby dance like there s nobody looking slide like you re coming my way shake like you know what you re doing we re out all night and sleep all day na na na na men in love na na na na men in love with each other hey re intro shame shame shame ooooh i i i i shame shame shame i can t remember having so much fun when morning comes everybody s waking up with someone on the run dance like there s nobody looking slide like you re coming my way shake like you know what you re doing we re out all night and sleep all day na na na na men in love na na na na men in love na na na na men in love na na na na men in love with each other hey since the beginning of time put your hand in mine come along and you ll find it s the perfect crime ohh ohh ohh ohh na na na na men in love na na na na men in love na na na na men in love na na na na men in love with each other na na na na men in love na na na na men in love na na na na men in love na na na na men in love with each other,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The song's repeated mention of 'shame' superficially aligns with the user's feeling of shame, but the overall tone and content of the song do not reflect the emotional depth or specific context of the user's experience. The song's focus on dancing, having fun, and romantic themes diverges significantly from the user's situation of feeling ridiculed and ashamed after a personal confession. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack depth, which affects their coherence and relevance to the user's emotional state."
My new air fryer arrives in only a week! I want to use it right now!,i wanna go to mexico take my fishing rod catch a fish taco i wanna eat a burrito today i wanna go to italy get tangled up in spaghetti share a pizza with myself and me today i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world today i wanna go somewhere in france wine and dine without my pants have a snail trail leading up to my mouth today i wanna go to japan eat all the sushi that i can make my way to sweden even though i ve eaten today i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world today i wanna go to america hang out with the movie stars eat a thousand cheese burgers in my car today i wanna go to africa eat a bowl of ebola go to mozambique to get something to eat today i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world today ,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song's lyrics express a strong desire to eat various foods from around the world, which loosely aligns with the user's excitement about receiving a new air fryer to cook food. However, the emotional alignment is only moderate (scored 2) because the song focuses more on global culinary exploration rather than the anticipation of cooking at home with a new appliance. Contextually, the song is not very relevant (scored 1) as it discusses traveling and eating internationally rather than cooking at home or using kitchen appliances. The lyrical coherence is somewhat fluent but repetitive and somewhat nonsensical in places, such as the mention of 'eating a bowl of ebola,' which detracts from the overall coherence (scored 2)."
"I had a terrifying moment recently—my whole body froze, and I felt like something horrible was about to happen.",awakened by the fear of an omnipresent danger and the absence of touch accordingly my heart beats alone sucked dry of all emotion it bleeds for feeling but i m so scared i ll run into another wall afraid to lose my mortality i stand alone shivering cold alone naked for the world to see breathing becomes easy as i come closer to confronting my fear now i lay in that same dead end state as i was before frozen from your icy touch cold as i was before alone for the world to see,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The song lyrics strongly align with the user's emotional state of fear and the sensation of being frozen, scoring high in emotional alignment. The context of confronting fear and feeling exposed is relevant to the user's experience of a terrifying moment, though it slightly diverges in its focus on a more general existential fear rather than a specific incident, hence the slightly lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are coherent and fluently convey the themes of fear, isolation, and vulnerability, though some abstract expressions might slightly obscure the directness of the message, affecting the coherence score."
"I’ve been reflecting lately, and I just feel really grateful for everything and everyone that I have in my life.",i woke up this morning growth in my right mind counting all the blessings i ve had in my lifetime i m so fortunate to have someone like god heavenly father when i was having so many problems no one but him could help me solve them he stepped in and he made everything okay and for this i m so grateful i m grateful so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful i m so thankful to be in the land of the living i don t mind sharing my testimony to anyone who hear it cause i m led by the spirit and it s possible that something i might say could help along the way yeah been through the storm but here i m still standing on solid ground i keep on landing that s why i have so much faith in god for his love i m grateful i m grateful so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful i m so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful i m so thankful to be in the land of the living  oh yeah i m grateful yes i m thankful he spared me he gave me another chance i am i m grateful so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful i m so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful i m so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The song lyrics align exceptionally well with the user's emotional state of gratitude, as evidenced by repeated expressions of thankfulness and appreciation for life's blessings, scoring a 5 for emotional alignment. Contextually, the song fits the theme of gratitude but introduces specific religious elements which might not universally resonate depending on the user's personal beliefs, hence a score of 4. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express gratitude, though the repetitive structure might impact the lyrical depth slightly, resulting in a coherence score of 4. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's feelings of gratitude, with a slight deduction for potential thematic specificity and repetitiveness."
"Someone very important to me is gone, and no matter how much time passes, I still feel the weight of that loss.",i ve been so long without you i try not to think about you but i do i know that i m to blame i got no right to call your name but i do i do i m so hurt to think that you d lie to me i m hurt way down deep inside of me,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song captures the emotion of enduring pain and loss, aligning well with the user's feelings of persistent grief. The lyrics express a deep sense of hurt and longing, resonating with the emotional weight described in the prompt. Contextually, the song touches on themes of loss and remembrance, though it slightly deviates by suggesting betrayal ('you'd lie to me'), which may not perfectly align with the user's narrative of simply missing someone important. The lyrics are coherent and convey a clear emotional narrative, though the focus on betrayal might slightly distract from the primary theme of loss due to death or absence."
I've been smiling for the last three hours. I can't believe this is my life,i got a big surprise when i saw you smile i never dreamed that it could be but now i realize since i saw you smile there s only happiness for me so bye bye blues bye bye blues bells ring birds sing sun is shining no more pining just we two smiling thru don t sigh don t cry bye bye blues blues,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The recommended song lyrics align exceptionally well with the user's emotional state of continuous smiling and feeling of disbelief at their happiness. The lyrics 'i got a big surprise when i saw you smile' and 'there s only happiness for me' directly reflect the user's joy and surprise. Contextually, the song fits well as it talks about a transformative moment of happiness, similar to the user's experience. The lyrics are coherent and follow a clear narrative about moving from a state of blues to joy, although some repetition and simplistic rhyming slightly affect the depth of lyrical expression. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's emotional and contextual prompt."
There’s someone I can’t stop thinking about lately. I think I’m in love with them.,ohhh yeah ohhh baby ohhh yeah i m in love with a good woman who understands she can t go far in this world if she hasn t got a good man i m in love i m in love love love love make me feel good all over i m in love i know yall know what i m talkin about i ts like this i feel just like a baby boy on christmas day with a brand new toy i m in love yeah i m in love love love bobby play your guitar ohhhh make me feel good do it again do it again and again and again if you got somebody you can call your very own i know y all know what i m talkin about,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a strong emotional alignment with the user's feelings of being in love, scoring a 4. The repeated affirmations of love and the joy it brings resonate well with the user's sentiment. Contextually, the song fits the theme of love, scoring a 3, as it speaks about the singer's deep affection and connection with their partner, which aligns with the user's thoughts about someone they are in love with. However, the lyrics lack a bit in coherence, scoring a 2, due to repetitive phrases and a somewhat disjointed narrative that might make it harder for the user to fully connect with the song's message. Overall, the song moderately suits the user's emotional and contextual needs but could benefit from more structured lyrics."
I stood in front of a huge and wasn't able to blurt out a single sentence. My knees were shaking the whole time.,i spent my night sweating through my clothes and screaming til my throat ached like burning coals still its not right now that everything i know gets caught between the gnashing teeth of the hype machine and so it goes ive never felt more alone,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.7,"The song captures a sense of intense emotional distress and physical discomfort, which aligns with the user's description of feeling overwhelmed and physically shaky. However, the song's focus on screaming and feeling alone due to external pressures (like a 'hype machine') does not directly reflect the user's specific scenario of being unable to speak in front of a crowd. The lyrics, while expressive, are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making them less directly relevant to the user's context of public speaking anxiety. The coherence of the lyrics is moderate, as they convey a clear emotional intensity but lack a straightforward narrative or context."
I just know that tomorrow is going to be the best day ever,walkin side by side we scale the mountains high oh oh throw fingers up for weather for you i ll collect feathers oh oh may tomorrow be this good the wolves howl through the night and though they re out of sight i move close to your side there s no one but each other wouldn t want no other may tomorrow be this good the blisters on our feet are fading bittersweet and i look up at you i see the future through and i see i see that tomorrow will be so good too tomorrow will be so good be so good be so good be so,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song lyrics align perfectly with the user's emotional state of anticipation and optimism about tomorrow being a great day. The repeated lines 'may tomorrow be this good' and 'tomorrow will be so good' directly reflect the user's sentiment, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song fits well as it talks about looking forward to the future and enjoying the present moment, which matches the user's hopeful outlook. The lyrics are mostly coherent, maintaining a clear narrative about companionship and shared experiences, though some lines might seem slightly abstract, affecting the coherence score slightly."
"Today someone told me I don't belong, but I know that I must fight for my ideals and show them to the world!",i know this is wrong you say the word i ll be the war i am the blood i am all that you know i see the devil and i know your name our time has come no matter what you say the voids we fill don t make us beautiful all the hope that we kill will slowly end us take the time to heal til then refuse it so cut it down i want the fight without a choice say the word and all is yours i m the blood i m the chosen give them something to see here,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a strong sense of defiance and resilience, aligning well with the user's emotional state of feeling rejected yet determined to fight for their ideals (Emotional alignment: 4). The context of fighting and standing up for oneself is relevant to the user's situation, though the lyrics' focus on war and blood might not perfectly align with the user's context of ideological struggle (Contextual relevance: 3). The lyrics, while intense and passionate, are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative flow, making them less coherent and harder to follow (Lyrical coherence: 2). Overall, the song captures the spirit of defiance and the will to prove oneself, but its aggressive tone and lack of lyrical clarity might not fully resonate with the user's experience."
"After going over the situation again, something finally clicked for me. I understand now what I didn’t see before.",i think i need a new progression a new perspective i think it s finally time i realized i learned my lesson i think i m ready for my life to come and get me now now i m not one to know it all but this i know is true they say that everything you need is right inside of you i think i m ready for my life to come and get me now ohhoo i think i m ready for my life to come and get me,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics align well with the user's emotional state of having a moment of realization and readiness for what's next, as reflected in the lines 'i think it's finally time i realized i learned my lesson' and 'i think i'm ready for my life to come and get me now.' These lyrics capture the essence of understanding and preparedness that the user described. Contextually, the song fits the theme of self-discovery and moving forward, which matches the user's description of a newfound understanding. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and simplistic but still effectively convey the intended message."
After today’s show I was finally able to relax for a while,tried to call you n got the answer phone now i m glad i m free to spend a weekend on my own do the shopping jog in the park and there s a lot of housework that needs to be done i m turning myself into a superhero of sorts and i m so happy now you didn t take my call this morning,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song's emotional tone partially aligns with the user's feeling of relaxation after a show, as it describes a sense of relief and personal freedom. However, the song also introduces themes of being ignored and having to do chores, which might not perfectly resonate with the user's mood of simple relaxation. Contextually, the song's mention of personal time and activities like shopping and jogging could be relevant to relaxing but is diluted by the focus on unreturned calls and housework. The lyrics lack some coherence due to the absence of punctuation and somewhat disjointed ideas, making it harder to follow the narrative smoothly."
"The more I think about it, the more I realize I made a terrible mistake. I really regret what I did.",i regret leaving my soul i forgot i needed it to feel and maybe when i die i ll just grab it real quick i m coming right back i regret leaving my mind i forgot i needed it to think and maybe to keep me alive i can t believe i got so far with a head so empty but i still have eyes wait for me wait for me but i still have feet wait for me wait for me i regret leaving at all i forgot i needed god like big brother and maybe when i die yeah when i die i won t die escaping i ll die returning to the fold but i still have eyes wait for me wait for me but i still have feet wait for me wait for me but i still have faith if i ever had faith wait for me wait for me,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics align well with the user's emotional state of regret and reflection on past mistakes, scoring high on emotional alignment. The theme of regret and the desire for redemption or return ('wait for me') in the lyrics also fits closely with the context of the user's prompt, thus scoring high on contextual relevance. However, the lyrical coherence is moderately rated as the repetitive and somewhat disjointed nature of the lyrics might make it harder for some listeners to follow the narrative or the thematic depth consistently."
I haven’t been able to stop crying. I just feel this overwhelming sadness I don’t know how to handle.,halfway in and i m feeling so left alone look right through and it s hard enough to see it go am i blind to think that it would never end left behind i should ve known that it was over then and it s all gone now it s so sad to say it and you re so down it s so sad to see you lost and found and those feelings are dragging you down feeling so feeling low down and we re nowhere near the end and it s all gone now it s so sad to say it and you re so down it s so sad to see you it s so sad to see you go,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics resonate well with the user's expressed feelings of overwhelming sadness and the sense of being alone, scoring high on emotional alignment. The context of feeling left behind and the sadness of an ending aligns moderately with the user's situation. However, the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear structure, which affects their coherence and overall impact. The song captures the essence of sadness and loss but could be more coherent to fully support the user's emotional state."
My family just told me something completely unexpected... I’m still trying to wrap my head around it.,well i was ready to walk into your heart i ll make believe there s something i ve lost but i think you know what i ve done oh i think you know i ll be your surprise it s just a secret that s alwasy on display or just a memory you can t throw away oh i ll be your surprise,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song's lyrics touch on themes of surprise and hidden secrets, which loosely aligns with the user's emotional state of dealing with unexpected news. However, the connection is vague and not directly addressing the emotional turmoil or confusion typically associated with such situations, leading to a low score in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song seems to revolve around a personal relationship and the element of surprise within it, which doesn't strongly relate to the user's scenario of receiving unexpected family news, hence the low score in contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and cryptic, making it difficult to derive a clear and coherent message, resulting in a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
