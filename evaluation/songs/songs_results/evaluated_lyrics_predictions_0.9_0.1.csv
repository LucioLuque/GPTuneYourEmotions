Watching my teammate stay late to coach the interns after hours left me genuinely inspired.,let the sunshine let the sunshine in the sunshine in let the sunshine let the sunshine in the sunshine in we starve look at one another short of breath walking proudly in our winter coats wearing smells from laboratories facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy listening for the new told lies with supreme visions of lonely tunes let the sunshine let the sunshine in the sunshine in let the sunshine let the sunshine in the sunshine in somewhere inside something there s a rush of greatness who knows what stands in front of our lives i fashion my future on films in space silence tells me silence tells me secretly everything let the sunshine let the sunshine in the sunshine in let the sunshine let the sunshine in the sunshine in let the sunshine let the sunshine in the sunshine in stockholm sweden sweden across the baltic sea and i m a genius genius and i belive in god and i believe that god believes in jean pierre that s me that s me that s me singing our space songs on a spider web sitar life is around you and in you you gotta answer for army of lovers let the sunshine let the sunshine in the sunshine in let the sunshine let the sunshine in the sunshine in let the sunshine let the sunshine in the sunshine in let the sunshine let the sunshine in the sunshine in,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics, primarily from 'Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In' by The 5th Dimension, do not align well with the user's emotional and contextual prompt. The song's theme of optimism and broad calls for peace and love only slightly touch upon the emotion of inspiration, resulting in a low emotional alignment score. Contextually, the song does not specifically address themes of mentorship, teamwork, or personal growth, which are central to the user's experience, thus receiving a low contextual relevance score. The lyrical coherence of the song is also low, as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making it difficult to draw a clear narrative or message that relates directly to the user's described situation."
That clip of a golden retriever chasing bubbles still has me giggling at my desk.,animal crackers in my soup monkeys and rabbits loop the loop gosh oh gee but i have fun swallowing animals one by one in every bowl of soup i see lions and tigers watching me i make em jump right through a hoop those animal crackers in my soup when i get hold of the big bad wolf i just push him under to drown then i bite him in a million bits and i gobble him right down when their inside me where its dark i walk around like noahs arc i stuff my tummy like a goop with animal crackers in my soup animal crackers in my soup do funny things to me they make me think my neighbourhood is a big menagerie for instance there s our janitor his name is mr klein and when he hollers at us kids he reminds me of a lion animal crackers in my soup monkeys and rabbits loop the loop gosh oh gee but i have fun swallowing animals one by one in every bowl of soup i see lions and tigers watching me i make em jump right through a hoop those animal crackers in my soup when their inside me where its dark i walk around like noahs arc i stuff my tummy like a goop with animal crackers in my soup animal crackers in my soup monkeys and rabbits loop the loop gosh oh gee but i have fun swallowing animals one by one in every bowl of soup i see lions and tigers watching me i make em jump right through a hoop those animal crackers in my soup,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song 'Animal Crackers in My Soup' captures a playful and whimsical emotion, aligning well with the user's amusement from watching a golden retriever play. This earns it a high score in emotional alignment. However, the contextual relevance is moderate because, while both the song and the prompt involve playful scenarios, the song's focus on imaginary play with food and animals is a bit distant from the specific act of a dog chasing bubbles. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive but maintain a coherent narrative around the theme of playful imagination, leading to a moderate score in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song provides a cheerful and imaginative backdrop that somewhat complements the lightheartedness of the user's experience but doesn't perfectly match the specific context of the prompt."
The courier dumped my brand-new keyboard in a puddle and walked off—I'm fuming.,i skip the train at 9 because i didn t have the time to skim my card it takes too long i m sure that i ll be fine but i m not no no the stare of garish yellow and he s got me you know i move and hear him shout hey you we break at london fields i ask what is the deal conductor says the track s a mess cause someone s had enough i m like come on man you made me late you know you ve really fucked me and so the sanction that i get is on you i m sprinting from the train i m battered by the rain i say watch out i try to shout i hit him all the same i m like come on man you made me really late you ve really fucked me you know the sanction i get is on you come on man you made me really late you ve really fucked me you know the sanction i get it s on you it s on you ,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of frustration and urgency, which aligns well with the user's emotion of being 'fuming' due to the mishandling of their delivery. The narrative of being inconvenienced and the subsequent reaction to the situation ('you've really fucked me') mirrors the user's experience with the courier. However, the context of the song, involving a train and its conductor, is not a perfect match for the specific scenario of a courier and a damaged keyboard, hence the slightly lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story of frustration and the consequences of someone else's actions affecting the protagonist, which makes them easy to follow and understand."

My colleague refactored the legacy code and now it runs twice as fast—exactly what we needed.,we have the technology we have the technology1,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song's repeated phrase 'we have the technology' somewhat aligns with the theme of technological improvement and efficiency, as described in the user's prompt about refactoring legacy code. This reflects a moderate emotional alignment with the sense of achievement and progress. However, the song's relevance to the specific context of coding and work improvement is minimal, as the lyrics do not explicitly address these themes. The lyrical coherence is low due to the repetitive and vague nature of the lyrics, offering little narrative or detailed expression."

Why does this site have three different checkout buttons? I’m completely lost.,i dont know why its been so hard to find real people to connect with is it the sign of times the reasons why are we running out out of time its really difficult sometimes impossible to understand the mystery of life the mystery of our life the mystery of life the mystery of our life mystery of life mystery of life,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state or the context of their prompt. The user expresses confusion and frustration about the functionality of a website, which is a specific and practical issue. The song lyrics, however, delve into existential and philosophical themes about life and human connections, which do not relate to the user's concern about website navigation. Emotionally, the song captures a sense of being lost or overwhelmed, which slightly resonates with the user's frustration, hence the low score in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song is completely irrelevant as it does not address or reflect the user's situation regarding the checkout buttons. The lyrical coherence is somewhat low as the lyrics are repetitive and somewhat vague, though they maintain a basic structure and theme throughout."
I can’t stop wondering what the northern lights look like in person.,cut from the window pane over my bed out to the winter trails and where they have led i ve seen a few things going by and i still wonder why it becomes night cut from the riverbank is where you have bled out to the logging trails and where they have led i ve seen a few things going by and i still wonder why it becomes night,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.3,"The song lyrics provide a somewhat reflective and wondering tone, which aligns moderately with the user's emotional state of curiosity about the northern lights. However, the song does not specifically mention the northern lights or similar phenomena, leading to an average score in contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and cryptic, making it difficult to fully grasp a coherent narrative or clear message, which affects the lyrical coherence score."
It's only Tuesday and I'm already day-dreaming about sinking into a hammock by the sea in my weekend.,its a time to just float away forget about the rest of the day a place where no one else can go where my thoughts and i can be alone need a way when it gets too much the pressures on worlds in a rush something snaps inside of me i am high above the ground just the clouds and me just the clouds and me so every night and im not there every talk but i dont care every call but ive checked out you ll know what its all about its my dream time make believe time wild and free time in my mind its my dream time fantasy time when i leave my leave my cares behind when i need to turn the volume down and i dont want no one else around got to stop this crazy show and sometimes i even shut my phone so i take a breath and clear my head and forget about what everyone said just gonna let my mind be free i am high above the ground just the clouds and me just the clouds and me so every night and im not there seem out of it and unaware the lights are on but im not home you ll know when or where ive gone its my dream time make believe time wild and free time in my mind its my dream time fantasy time when i leave my leave my cares behind dream time dream time gonna sail across the sky y gonna let my spirit fly high no ones gonna take up my time gonna sail across the sky y gonna let my spirit fly high no ones gonna take up my time so every night and im not there seem out of it and unaware the lights are on but im not home you ll know when or where ive gone its my dream time make believe time wild and free time in my mind its my dream time fantasy time when i leave my leave my cares behind dream dream dream dream time,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song aligns well with the user's emotional state of day-dreaming and longing for a peaceful escape, as it talks about floating away, being alone with one's thoughts, and escaping the pressures of the world. This matches the user's desire to relax in a hammock by the sea. Contextually, the song's theme of seeking a personal, tranquil space to 'leave cares behind' and 'sail across the sky' resonates with the idea of a weekend getaway. However, the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and could be more concise, which affects their coherence. The overall score reflects a good match in terms of emotional and contextual relevance, with some room for improvement in lyrical clarity."

The song's lyrics are abstract and surreal, discussing various unrelated and fantastical scenarios, which do not resonate with the user's professional context. The lyrics are somewhat coherent within their own abstract and whimsical style, but they do not make logical sense in a conventional way, which might further alienate a user seeking empathy or relevance to their situation."
My teammate keeps blaring voice notes on speaker in the open office; I swear earbuds were invented for a reason.,a recent and indifferent impressions in the dream if i now consult my own experience with regard to the origin of the elements appearing in the dream content i must in the first place express the opinion that in every dream we may find some reference to the experiences of the preceding day whatever dream i turn to whether my own or someone else s this experience is always confirmed knowing this i may perhaps begin the work of interpretation by looking for the experience of the preceding day which has stimulated the dream in many cases this is indeed the quickest way with the two dreams which i subjected to a close analysis in the last chapter the reference to the preceding day is so evident that it needs no further elucidation but in order to show how constantly this reference may be demonstrated i shall examine a portion of my own dream chronicle i shall relate only so much of the dreams as is necessary for the detection of the dream source in question 1 i pay a call at a house to which i gain admittance only with difficulty etc and meanwhile i am keeping a woman waiting for me source a conversation during the evening with a female relative to the effect that she would have to wait for a remittance for which she had asked until etc 2 i have written a monograph on a species of plant source in the morning i had seen in a bookseller s window a monograph on the genus cyclamen 3 i see two women in the street mother and daughter the latter being a patient source a female patient who is under treatment had told me in the evening what difficulties her mother puts in the way of her continuing the treatment 4 at s and r s bookshop i subscribe to a periodical which costs 20 florins annually source during the day my wife has reminded me that i still owe her 20 florins of her weekly allowance 5 i receive a communication from the social democratic committee in which i am addressed as a member source i have received simultaneous communications from the liberal committee on elections and from the president of the humanitarian society of which latter i am actually a member 6 a man on a steep rock rising from the sea in the manner of bocklin source dreyfus on devil s island also news from my relatives in england etc the question might be raised whether a dream invariably refers to the events of the preceding day only or whether the reference may be extended to include impressions from a longer period of time in the immediate past this question is probably not of the first importance but i am inclined to decide in favour of the exclusive priority of the day before the dream whenever i thought i had found a case where an impression two or three days old was the source of the dream i was able to convince myself after careful investigation that this impression had been remembered the day before that is that a demonstrable reproduction on the day before had been interpolated between the day of the event and the time of the dream and further i was able to point to the recent occasion which might have given rise to the recollection of the older impression on the other hand i was unable to convince myself that a regular interval of biological significance elapses between the dream exciting daytime impression and its recurrence in the dream i believe therefore that for every dream a dream stimulus may be found among these experiences on which one has not yet slept havelock ellis who has likewise given attention to this problem states that he has not been able to find any such periodicity of reproduction in his dreams although he has looked for it he relates a dream in which he found himself in spain he wanted to travel to a place called daraus varaus or zaraus on awaking he was unable to recall any such place names and thought no more of the matter a few months later he actually found the name zaraus it was that of a railway station between san sebastian and bilbao through which he had passed in the train eight months before the date of the dream thus the impressions of the immediate past stand in the same relation to the dream content as those of periods indefinitely remote the dream may select its material from any period of life provided only that a chain of thought leads back from the experiences of the day of the dream of that earlier period but why this preference for recent impressions we shall arrive at some conjectures on this point if we subject one of the dreams already mentioned to a more precise analysis i select the dream of the botanical monograph i have written a monograph on a certain plant the book lies before me i am just turning over a folded coloured plate a dried specimen of the plant as though from a herbarium is bound up with every copy analysis in the morning i saw in a bookseller s window a volume entitled the genus cyclamen apparently a monograph on this plant the cyclamen is my wife s favorite flower i reproach myself for remembering so seldom to bring her flowers as she would like me to do in connection with the theme of giving her flowers i am reminded of a story which i recently told some friends of mine in proof of my assertion that we often forget in obedience to a purpose of the unconscious and that forgetfulness always enables us to form a deduction about the secret disposition of the forgetful person a young woman who has been accustomed to receive a bouquet of flowers from her husband on her birthday misses this token of affection on one of her birthdays and bursts into tears the husband comes in and cannot understand why she is crying until she tells him today is my birthday he claps his hand to his forehead and exclaims oh forgive me i had completely forgotten it and proposes to go out immediately in order to get her flowers but she refuses to be consoled for she sees in her husband s forgetfulness a proof that she no longer plays the same part in his thoughts as she formerly did this frau l met my wife two days ago told her that she was feeling well and asked after me some years ago she was a patient of mine supplementary facts i did once actually write something like a monograph on a plant namely an essay on the coca plant which attracted the attention of k koller to the anaesthetic properties of cocaine i had hinted that the alkaloid might be employed as an anaesthetic but i was not thorough enough to pursue the matter farther it occurs to me too that on the morning of the day following the dream i had thought of cocaine in a kind of day dream if i were ever afflicted with glaucoma i would go to berlin and there undergo an operation incognito in the house of my berlin friend at the hands of a surgeon whom he would recommend the surgeon who would not know the name of his patient would boast as usual how easy these operations had become since the introduction of cocaine and i should not betray the fact that i myself had a share in this discovery with this phantasy were connected thoughts of how awkward it really is for a physician to claim the professional services of a colleague i should be able to pay the berlin eye specialist who did not know me like anyone else only after recalling this day dream do i realize that there is concealed behind it the memory of a definite event shortly after koller s discovery my father contracted glaucoma he was operated on by my friend dr koenigstein the eye specialist dr koller was in charge of the cocaine anaesthetization and he made the remark that on this occasion all the three persons who had been responsible for the introduction of cocaine had been brought together my thoughts now pass on to the time when i was last reminded of the history of cocaine this was a few days earlier when i received a festschrift a publication in which grateful pupils had commemorated the jubilee of their teacher and laboratory director among the titles to fame of persons connected with the laboratory i found a note to the effect that the discovery of the anaesthetic properties of cocaine had been due to k koller now i suddenly become aware that the dream is connected with an experience of the previous evening i had just accompanied dr koenigstein to his home and had entered into a discussion of a subject which excites me greatly whenever it is mentioned while i was talking with him in the entrance hall professor gartner and his young wife came up i could not refrain from congratulating them both upon their blooming appearance now professor gartner is one of the authors of the festschrift of which i have just spoken and he may well have reminded me of it and frau l of whose birthday disappointment i spoke a little way back had been mentioned though of course in another connection in my conversation with dr koenigstein i shall now try to elucidate the other determinants of the dream content a dried specimen of the plant accompanies the monograph as though it were a herbarium and herbarium reminds me of the gymnasium the director of our gymnasium once called the pupils of the upper classes together in order that they might examine and clean the gymnasium herbarium small insects had been found book worms the director seemed to have little confidence in my ability to assist for he entrusted me with only a few of the pages i know to this day that there were crucifers on them my interest in botany was never very great at my preliminary examination in botany i was required to identify a crucifer and failed to recognize it had not my theoretical knowledge come to my aid i should have fared badly indeed crucifers suggest composites the artichoke is really a composite and in actual fact one which i might call my favourite flower my wife more thoughtful than i often brings this favourite flower of mine home from the market i see the monograph which i have written lying before me here again there is an association my friend wrote to me yesterday from berlin i am thinking a great deal about your dream book i see it lying before me completed and i turn the pages how i envied him this power of vision if only i could see it lying before me already completed the folded coloured plate when i was a medical student i suffered a sort of craze for studying monographs exclusively in spite of my limited means i subscribed to a number of the medical periodicals whose coloured plates afforded me much delight i was rather proud of this inclination to thoroughness when i subsequently began to publish books myself i had to draw the plates for my own treatises and i remember one of them turned out so badly that a well meaning colleague ridiculed me for it with this is associated i do not exactly know how a very early memory of my childhood my father by the way of a jest once gave my elder sister and myself a book containing coloured plates in order that we might destroy it from an educational point of view this was hardly to be commended i was at the time five years old and my sister less than three and the picture of us two children blissfully tearing the book to pieces is almost the only one from this period of my life which has remained vivid in my memory when i afterwards became a student i developed a conspicuous fondness for collecting and possessing books i became a book worm ever since i have been engaged in introspection i have always traced this earliest passion of my life to this impression of my childhood or rather i have recognized in this childish scene a screen or concealing memory for my subsequent bibliophilia and of course i learned at an early age that our passions often become our misfortunes when i was seventeen i ran up a very considerable account at the bookseller s with no means with which to settle it and my father would hardly accept it as an excuse that my passion was at least a respectable one but the mention of this experience of my youth brings me back to my conversation with my friend dr koenigstein on the evening preceding the dream for one of the themes of this conversation was the same old reproach that i am much too absorbed in my hobbies for reasons which are not relevant here i shall not continue the interpretation of this dream but will merely indicate the path which leads to it in the course of the interpretation i was reminded of my conversation with dr koenigstein and indeed of more than one portion of it when i consider the subjects touched upon in this conversation the meaning of the dream immediately becomes clear to me all the trains of thought which have been started my own inclinations and those of my wife the cocaine the awkwardness of securing medical treatment from one s own colleagues my preference for monographical studies and my neglect of certain subjects such as botany all these are continued in and lead up to one branch or another of this widely ramified conversation the dream once more assumes the character of a justification of a plea for my rights it even continues the theme which that dream introduced and discusses it in association with the new subject matter which has been added in the interval between the two dreams even the dream s apparently indifferent form of expression at once acquires a meaning now it means i am indeed the man who has written that valuable and successful treatise just as previously i declared in self justification i am after all a thorough and industrious student and in both instances i find the meaning i can allow myself this but i may dispense with the further interpretation of the dream because my only purpose in recording it was to examine the relation of the dream content to the experience of the previous day which arouses it as long as i know only the manifest content of this dream only one relation to any impression of the day is obvious but after i have completed the interpretation a second source of the dream becomes apparent in another experience of the same day the first of these impressions to which the dream refers is an indifferent one a subordinate circumstance i see a book in a shop window whose title holds me for a moment but whose contents would hardly interest me the second experience was of great psychic value i talked earnestly with my friend the eye specialist for about an hour i made allusions in this conversation which must have ruffled the feelings of both of us and which in me awakened memories in connection with which i was aware of a great variety of inner stimuli further this conversation was broken off unfinished because some acquaintances joined us what now is the relation of these two impressions of the day to one another and to the dream which followed during the night in the manifest dream content i find merely an allusion to the indifferent impression and i am thus able to reaffirm that the dream prefers to take up into its content experiences of a non essential character in the dream interpretation on the contrary everything converges upon the important and justifiably disturbing event if i judge the sense of the dream in the only correct way according to the latent content which is brought to light in the analysis i find that i have unwittingly lighted upon a new and important discovery i see that the puzzling theory that the dream deals only with the worthless odds and ends of the day s experiences has no justification i am also compelled to contradict the assertion that the psychic life of the waking state is not continued in the dream and that hence the dream wastes our psychic energy on trivial material the very opposite is true what has claimed our attention during the day dominates our dream thoughts also and we take pains to dream only in connection with such matters as have given us food for thought during the day perhaps the most immediate explanation of the fact that i dream of the indifferent impression of the day while the impression which has with good reason excited me causes me to dream is that here again we are dealing with the phenomenon of dream distortion which we have referred to as a psychic force playing the part of a censorship the recollection of the monograph on the genus cyclamen is utilized as though it were an allusion to the conversation with my friend just as the mention of my patient s friend in the dream of the deferred supper is represented by the allusion smoked salmon the only question is by what intermediate links can the impression of the monograph come to assume the relation of allusion to the conversation with the eye specialist since such a relation is not at first perceptible in the example of the deferred supper the relation is evident at the outset smoked salmon as the favourite dish of the patient s friend belongs to the circle of ideas which the friend s personality would naturally evoke in the mind of the dreamer in our new example we are dealing with two entirely separate impressions which at first glance seem to have nothing in common except indeed that they occur on the same day the monograph attracts my attention in the morning in the evening i take part in the conversation the answer furnished by the analysis is as follows such relations between the two impressions as do not exist from the first are established subsequently between the idea content of the one impression and the idea content of the other i have already picked out the intermediate links emphasized in the course of writing the analysis only under some outside influence perhaps the recollection of the flowers missed by frau l would the idea of the monograph on the cyclamen have attached itself to the idea that the cyclamen is my wife s favourite flower i do not believe that these inconspicuous thoughts would have sufficed to evoke a dream there needs no ghost my lord come from the grave to tell us this as we read in hamlet but behold in the analysis i am reminded that the name of the man who interrupted our conversation was gartner and that i thought his wife looked blooming indeed now i even remember that one of my female patients who bears the pretty name of flora was for a time the main subject of our conversation it must have happened that by means of these intermediate links from the sphere of botanical ideas the association was effected between the two events of the day the indifferent one and the stimulating one other relations were then established that of cocaine for example which can with perfect appropriateness form a link between the person of dr koenigstein and the botanical monograph which i have written and thus secure the fusion of the two circles of ideas so that now a portion of the first experience may be used as an allusion to the second i am prepared to find this explanation attacked as either arbitrary or artificial what would have happened if professor gartner and his blooming wife had not appeared and if the patient who was under discussion had been called not flora but anna and yet the answer is not hard to find if these thought relations had not been available others would probably have been selected it is easy to establish relations of this sort as the jocular questions and conundrums with which we amuse ourselves suffice to show the range of wit is unlimited to go a step farther if no sufficiently fertile associations between the two impressions of the day could have been established the dream would simply have followed a different course another of the indifferent impressions of the day such as come to us in multitudes and are forgotten would have taken the place of the monograph in the dream would have formed an association with the content of the conversation and would have represented this in the dream since it was the impression of the monograph and no other that was fated to perform this function this impression was probably that most suitable for the purpose one need not like lessing s hanschen schlau be astonished that only the rich people of the world possess the most money still the psychological process by which according to our exposition the indifferent experience substitutes itself for the psychologically important one seems to us odd and open to question in a later chapter we shall undertake the task of making the peculiarities of this seemingly incorrect operation more intelligible here we are concerned only with the result of this process which we were compelled to accept by constantly recurring experiences in the analysis of dreams in this process it is as though in the course of the intermediate steps a displacement occurs let us say of the psychic accent until ideas of feeble potential by taking over the charge from ideas which have a stronger initial potential reach a degree of intensity which enables them to force their way into consciousness such displacements do not in the least surprise us when it is a question of the transference of affective magnitudes or of motor activities that the lonely spinster transfers her affection to animals that the bachelor becomes a passionate collector that the soldier defends a scrap of coloured cloth his flag with his life blood that in a love affair a clasp of the hands a moment longer than usual evokes a sensation of bliss or that in othello a lost handkerchief causes an outburst of rage all these are examples of psychic displacements which to us seem incontestable but if by the same means and in accordance with the same fundamental principles a decision is made as to what is to reach our consciousness and what is to be withheld from it that is to say what we are to think this gives us the impression of morbidity and if it occurs in waking life we call it an error of thought we may here anticipate the result of a discussion which will be undertaken later namely that the psychic process which we have recognized in dream displacement proves to be not a morbidly deranged process but one merely differing from the normal one of a more primary nature thus we interpret the fact that the dream content takes up remnants of trivial experiences as a manifestation of dream distortion and we thereupon remember that we have recognized this dream distortion as the work of a censorship operating between the two psychic instances we may therefore expect that dream analysis will constantly show us the real and psychically significant source of the dream in the events of the day the memory of which has transferred its accentuation to some indifferent memory this conception is in complete opposition to robert s theory which consequently has no further value for us the fact which robert was trying to explain simply does not exist its assumption is based on a misunderstanding on a failure to substitute the real meaning of the dream for its apparent meaning a further objection to robert s doctrine is as follows if the task of the dream were really to rid our memory by means of a special psychic activity of the slag of the day s recollections our sleep would perforce be more troubled engaged in more strenuous work than we can suppose it to be judging by our waking thoughts for the number of the indifferent impressions of the day against which we should have to protect our memory is obviously immeasurably large the whole night would not be long enough to dispose of them all it is far more probable that the forgetting of the indifferent impressions takes place without any active interference on the part of our psychic powers still something cautions us against taking leave of robert s theory without further consideration we have left unexplained the fact that one of the indifferent impressions of the day indeed even of the previous day constantly makes a contribution to the dream content the relations between this impression and the real source of the dream in the unconscious do not always exist from the outset as we have seen they are established subsequently while the dream is actually at work as though to serve the purpose of the intended displacement something therefore must necessitate the opening up of connections in the direction of the recent but indifferent impression this impression must possess some quality that gives it a special fitness otherwise it would be just as easy for the dream thoughts to shift their accentuation to some inessential component of their own sphere of ideas experiences such as the following show us the way to an explanation if the day has brought us two or more experiences which are worthy to evoke a dream the dream will blend the allusion of both into a single whole it obeys a compulsion to make them into a single whole for example one summer afternoon i entered a railway carriage in which i found two acquaintances of mine who were unknown to one another one of them was an influential colleague the other a member of a distinguished family which i had been attending in my professional capacity i introduced the two gentlemen to each other but during the long journey they conversed with each other through me so that i had to discuss this or that topic now with one now with the other i asked my colleague to recommend a mutual acquaintance who had just begun to practise as a physician he replied that he was convinced of the young man s ability but that his undistinguished appearance would make it difficult for him to obtain patients in the upper ranks of society to this i rejoined that is precisely why he needs recommendation a little later turning to my other fellow traveller i inquired after the health of his aunt the mother of one of my patients who was at this time prostrated by a serious illness on the night following this journey i dreamt that the young friend whom i had asked one of my companions to recommend was in a fashionable drawing room and with all the bearing of a man of the world was making before a distinguished company in which i recognized all the rich and aristocratic persons of my acquaintance a funeral oration over the old lady who was the aunt of my second fellow traveller thus my dream had once more found the connection between the two impressions of the day and by means of the two had constructed a unified situation in view of many similar experiences i am persuaded to advance the proposition that a dream works under a kind of compulsion which forces it to combine into a unified whole all the sources of dream stimulation which are offered to it in a subsequent chapter we shall consider this impulse of combination as part of the process of condensation another primary psychic process i shall now consider the question whether the dream exciting source to which our analysis leads us must always be a recent event or whether a subjective experience that is to say the recollection of a psychologically significant event a train of thought may assume the role of a dream stimulus the very definite answer derived from numerous analyses is as follows the stimulus of the dream may be a subjective transaction which has been made recent as it were by the mental activity of the day and this is perhaps the best time to summarize in schematic form the different conditions under which the dream sources are operative the source of a dream may be a recent and psychologically significant event which is directly represented in the dream several recent and significant events which are combined by the dream in a single whole one or more recent and significant events which are represented in the dream content by allusion to a contemporary but indifferent event a subjectively significant experience which is constantly represented in the dream by allusion to a recent but indifferent impression as may be seen in dream interpretation the condition is always fulfilled that one component of the dream content repeats a recent impression of the day of the dream the component which is destined to be represented in the dream may either belong to the same circle of ideas as the dream stimulus itself or it may originate in the neighbourhood of an indifferent impression which has been brought by more or less abundant associations into relation with the sphere of the dream stimulus the apparent multiplicity of these conditions results merely from the alternative that a displacement has or has not occurred and it may here be noted that this alternative enables us to explain the contrasts of the dream quite as readily as the medical theory of the dream explains the series of states from the partial to the complete waking of the brain cells in considering this series of sources we note further that the psychologically significant but not recent element may be replaced for the purposes of dream formation by a recent but psychologically indifferent element provided the two following conditions are fulfilled the dream content preserves a connection with things recently experienced the dream stimulus is still a psychologically significant event in one single case both these conditions are fulfilled by the same impression if we now consider that these same indifferent impressions which are utilized for the dream as long as they are recent lose this qualification as soon as they are a day older we are obliged to assume that the very freshness of an impression gives it a certain psychological value for dream formation somewhat equivalent to the value of emotionally accentuated memories or trains of thought later on in the light of certain psychological considerations we shall be able to divine the explanation of this importance of recent impressions in dream formation incidentally our attention is here called to the fact that at night and unnoticed by our consciousness important changes may occur in the material comprised by our ideas and memories the injunction that before making a final decision in any matter one should sleep on it for a night is obviously fully justified but at this point we find that we have passed from the psychology of dreaming to the psychology of sleep a step which there will often be occasion to take at this point there arises an objection which threatens to invalidate the conclusions at which we have just arrived if indifferent impressions can find their way into the dream only so long as they are of recent origin how does it happen that in the dream content we find elements also from earlier periods of our lives which at the time when they were still recent possessed as strumpell puts it no psychic value and which therefore ought to have been forgotten long ago elements that is which are neither fresh nor psychologically significant this objection can be disposed of completely if we have recourse to the results of the psychoanalysis of neurotics the solution is as follows the process of shifting and rearrangement which replaces material of psychic significance by material which is indifferent has already taken place in these earlier periods of life and has since become fixed in the memory those elements which were originally indifferent are in fact no longer so since they have acquired the value of psychologically significant material that which has actually remained indifferent can never be reproduced in the dream from the foregoing exposition the reader may rightly conclude that i assert that there are no indifferent dream stimuli and therefore no guileless dreams this i absolutely and unconditionally believe to be the case apart from the dreams of children and perhaps the brief dream reactions to nocturnal sensations apart from these exceptions whatever one dreams is either plainly recognizable as being psychically significant or it is distorted and can be judged correctly only after complete interpretation when it proves after all to be of psychic significance the dream never concerns itself with trifles we do not allow sleep to be disturbed by trivialities dreams which are apparently guileless turn out to be the reverse of innocent if one takes the trouble to interpret them if i may be permitted the expression they ail show the mark of the beast since this is another point on which i may expect contradiction and since i am glad of an opportunity to show dream distortion at work i shall here subject to analysis a number of guileless dreams from my collection i an intelligent and refined young woman who in real life is distinctly reserved one of those people of whom one says that still waters run deep relates the following dream i dreamt that i arrived at the market too late and could get nothing from either the butcher or the greengrocer woman surely a guileless dream but as it has not the appearance of a real dream i induce her to relate it in detail her report then runs as follows she goes to the market with her cook who carries the basket the butcher tells her after she has asked him for something that is no longer to be obtained and waits to give her something else with the remark that is good too she refuses and goes to the greengrocer woman the latter tries to sell her a peculiar vegetable which is bound up in bundles and is black in colour she says i don t know that i won t take it the connection of the dream with the preceding day is simple enough she had really gone to the market too late and had been unable to buy anything the meatshop was already closed comes into one s mind as a description of the experience but wait is not that a very vulgar phrase which or rather the opposite of which denotes a certain neglect with regard to man s clothing the dreamer has not used these words she has perhaps avoided them but let us look for the interpretation of the details contained in the dream when in a dream something has the character of a spoken utterance that is when it is said or heard not merely thought and the distinction can usually be made with certainty then it originates in the utterances of waking life which have of course been treated as raw material dismembered and slightly altered and above all removed from their context in the work of interpretation we may take such utterances as our starting point where then does the butcher s statement that is no longer to be obtained come from from myself i had explained to her some days previously that the oldest experiences of childhood are no longer to be obtained as such but will be replaced in the analysis by transferences and dreams thus i am the butcher and she refuses to accept these transferences to the present of old ways of thinking and feeling where does her dream utterance i don t know that i won t take it come from for the purposes of the analysis this has to be dissected i don t know that she herself had said to her cook with whom she had a dispute on the previous day but she had then added behave yourself decently here a displacement is palpable of the two sentences which she spoke to her cook she included the insignificant one in her dream but the suppressed sentence behave yourself decently alone fits in with the rest of the dream content one might use the words to a man who was making indecent overtures and had neglected to close his meat shop that we have really hit upon the trail of the interpretation is proved by its agreement with the allusions made by the incident with the greengrocer woman a vegetable which is sold tied up in bundles and is also black what can this be but a dream combination of asparagus and black radish i need not interpret asparagus to the initiated and the other vegetable too seems to me to point to the sexual theme at which we guessed in the beginning when we wanted to replace the story of the dream by the meat shop is closed we are not here concerned with the full meaning of the dream so much is certain that it is full of meaning and by no means guileless ii another guileless dream of the same patient which in some respects is a pendant to the above her husband asks her oughtn t we to have the piano tuned she replies it s not worth while the hammers would have to be rebuffed as well again we have the reproduction of an actual event of the preceding day her husband had asked her such a question and she had answered it in such words but what is the meaning of her dreaming it she says of the piano that it is a disgusting old box which has a bad tone it belonged to her husband before they were married etc but the key to the true solution lies in the phrase it isn t worth while this has its origin in a call paid yesterday to a woman friend she was asked to take off her coat but declined saying thanks it isn t worth while i must go in a moment at this point i recall that yesterday during the analysis she suddenly took hold of her coat of which a button had come undone it was as though she meant to say please don t look in it isn t worth while thus box becomes chest and the interpretation of the dream leads to the years when she was growing out of her childhood when she began to be dissatisfied with her figure it leads us back indeed to earlier periods if we take into consideration the disgusting and the bad tone and remember how often in allusions and in dreams the two small hemispheres of the female body take the place as a substitute and an antithesis of the large ones iii i will interrupt the analysis of this dreamer in order to insert a short innocent dream which was dreamed by a young man he dreamt that he was putting on his winter overcoat again this was terrible the occasion for this dream is apparently the sudden advent of cold weather on more careful examination we note that the two brief fragments of the dream do not fit together very well for what could be terrible about wearing a thick or heavy coat in cold weather unfortunately for the innocency of this dream the first association under analysis yields the recollection that yesterday a lady had confidentially confessed to him that her last child owed its existence to the splitting of a condom he now reconstructs his thoughts in accordance with this suggestion a thin condom is dangerous a thick one is bad the condom is a pullover for it is pulled over something and uebersieher is the german term for a light overcoat an experience like that related by the lady would indeed be terrible for an unmarried man we will now return to our other innocent dreamer iv she puts a candle into a candlestick but the candle is broken so that it does not stand up the girls at school say she is clumsy but she replies that it is not her fault here too there is an actual occasion for the dream the day before she had actually put a candle into a candlestick but this one was not broken an obvious symbolism has here been employed the candle is an object which excites the female genitals its being broken so that it does not stand upright signifies impotence on the man s part but does this young woman carefully brought up and a stranger to all obscenity know of such an application of the candle by chance she is able to tell how she came by this information while paddling a canoe on the rhine a boat passed her which contained some students who were singing rapturously or rather yelling when the queen of sweden behind closed shutters with the candles of apollo she does not hear or else understand the last word her husband was asked to give her the required explanation these verses are then replaced in the dream content by the innocent recollection of a task which she once performed clumsily at her boarding school because of the closed shutters the connection between the theme of masturbation and that of impotence is clear enough apollo in the latent dream content connects this dream with an earlier one in which the virgin pallas figured all this is obviously not innocent v lest it may seem too easy a matter to draw conclusions from dreams concerning the dreamer s real circumstances i add another dream originating with the same person which once more appears innocent i dreamt of doing something she relates which i actually did during the day that is to say i filled a little trunk so full of books that i had difficulty in closing it my dream was just like the actual occurrence here the dreamer herself emphasizes the correspondence between the dream and the reality all such criticisms of the dream and comments on the dream although they have found a place in the waking thoughts properly belong to the latent dream content as further examples will confirm we are told then that what the dream relates has actually occurred during the day it would take us too far afield to show how we arrive at the idea of making use of the english language to help us in the interpretation of this dream suffice it to say that it is again a question of a little box which has been filled so full that nothing can go into it in all these innocent dreams the sexual factor as the motive of the censorship is very prominent but this is a subject of primary significance which we must consider later footnotes cf the psycho pathology of everyday life the tendency of the dream at work to blend everything present of interest into a single transaction has already been noticed by several authors for instance by delage and delboeuf the dream of irma s injection the dream of the friend who is my uncle the dream of the funeral oration delivered by the young physician the dream of the botanical monograph the dreams of my patients during analysis are mostly of this kind cf chap vii on transference havelock ellis a kindly critic of the interpretation of dreams writes in the world of dreams from this point on not many of us will be able to follow f but mr ellis has not undertaken any analyses of dreams and will not believe how unjustifiable it is to judge them by the manifest dream content cf what is said of speech in dreams in the chapter on the dream work only one of the writers on the subject delboeuf seems to have recognized the origin of the speeches heard in dreams he compares them with cliches for the curious i may remark that behind the dream there is hidden a phantasy of indecent sexually provoking conduct on my part and of repulsion on the part of the lady if this interpretation should seem preposterous i would remind the reader of the numerous cases in which physicians have been made the object of such charges by hysterical women with whom the same phantasy has not appeared in a distorted form as a dream but has become undisguisedly conscious and delusional with this dream the patient began her psycho analytical treatment it was only later that i learned that with this dream she repeated the initial trauma in which her neurosis originated and since then i have noticed the same behaviour in other persons who in their childhood were victims of sexual attacks and now as it were wish in their dreams for them to be repeated a substitution by the opposite as will be clear after analysis ,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics are a verbose and complex analysis of dreams, their origins, and interpretations, which does not align with the user's emotional frustration or the contextual annoyance of a noisy office environment. The lyrics are more suited to a psychological or academic discussion on dream analysis rather than reflecting the user's feelings about inappropriate office behavior. The coherence of the lyrics is somewhat maintained as they follow a logical, if dense, exploration of dream theory, but this does not aid in aligning with the user's prompt."

The emotional alignment is low as the lyrics discuss themes of paranoia and self-aggrandizement, which do not connect with the simple disgust or surprise at a bad smell. Contextually, the lyrics are irrelevant to the situation described in the prompt, as they focus on themes of delusion and escape, rather than dealing with a domestic and mundane issue like sour milk. The lyrical coherence is slightly better, as the lyrics are somewhat understandable but still disjointed and lacking a clear narrative or theme that relates to the user's experience."

The lyrics suggest a more introspective and possibly confusing scenario, which doesn't match the light-hearted embarrassment of the user's situation. The lyrics themselves are somewhat abstract and disjointed, making them only moderately coherent. Overall, the song does not effectively capture the emotion or context of the user's experience."

The repeated phrases 'let's go' resonate with the urgency and thrill of heading to a significant event, making it contextually relevant, though not specifically about a sports event which would have been ideal. However, the lyrical coherence is lower due to the rapid, somewhat disjointed flow and the inclusion of various themes that diverge from the central excitement and readiness theme, making it harder to follow."
Someone knocked on the door at midnight and then went silent; my heart’s racing.,something in the air is calling me turn the light on something about the night that makes you see what you don t want i think about it every time i sleep there is someone creeping at me swear they re haunting me telling me run ooh i feel my body move without me again ooh like a sleepwalker getting closer to him ooh i feel my body move without me again ooh like a sleepwalker getting closer to him getting closer to you i think i might be going crazy now someone stop me forgot to lock the doors to keep me in didn t hide the key i feel the cold air i feel the dirt under my toes something tells me that i m far away and i m not alone now we re alone whispers disturb a quiet home no one will know no one darling come close i gotta hold you i gotta hold you i gotta hold you i gotta hold you 3,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics align well with the user's emotional state of fear and anxiety, as reflected by the imagery of someone creeping and haunting, which matches the prompt of a mysterious midnight occurrence. The context of the song, involving supernatural or fear-inducing elements, is relevant but not a perfect match since the song suggests a more internal, possibly dream-like or psychological scenario rather than a real physical event. The lyrics are coherent and create a vivid narrative, though some repetitive elements slightly detract from the overall clarity. Overall, the song captures the eerie and unsettling mood well, but the exact scenario differs slightly from the user's experience."
Got home drenched from the rain and found a thermos of hot tea waiting on my desk—little gestures like that rescue a day.,called in sick one day stepped out my front door squinted up at the sky and strapped on my backpack got into a van and when i returned i had ex wives and children boxes of photographs and they gave me some food and they didn t charge me and they gave me some coffee and they didn t charge me and when i was broke i needed it more but now that i m rich they give me coffee eating an ice cream cone texting with my thumbs flipping off the asshole who pulled into my lane life could be louder than something cracked up to be we all get new cells every seven years i feel seven today it s a good day to die again now they save me my place over there in a corner and i never get tickets now i only get warnings but when i was broke i needed it more and now that i m rich i get free coffee,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state or context. The user's prompt describes a comforting, warm scenario involving a thoughtful gesture that brightened their rainy day. The song lyrics, however, discuss various life experiences and reflections that are disjointed and do not relate to the specific warmth and comfort described in the prompt. The emotional alignment is low because the song does not capture the cozy, uplifted feeling from the prompt. The contextual relevance is also low as the song's themes of life's randomness and personal reflections do not match the simple, comforting scenario of finding hot tea. The lyrical coherence is slightly better, as the lyrics are somewhat fluent but lack a clear, cohesive narrative, making them only moderately coherent."

The lyrics express a deep dive into past memories, which resonates with the user's experience of being surrounded by reminders of their dad. However, the song's focus on a relationship and trust slightly diverts from the specific context of remembering a father, thus the contextual relevance is not as strong. The lyrics are coherent and convey a clear narrative of revisiting past emotions and memories, though they occasionally repeat themes which might slightly affect their impact."

The emotional alignment is low because the joy in the song is tied to a specific seasonal context rather than the broader, more personal achievement and elation of receiving a scholarship. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it discusses Christmas and not academic or personal achievement. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive but maintain a basic coherence, hence the moderate score in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional state or the context of their situation."

The prompt describes a moment of encouragement and warmth, conveyed through a simple, supportive note, which evokes feelings of reassurance and confidence. However, the song lyrics focus on a more abstract and surreal interaction, lacking a clear connection to the themes of support or personal encouragement. The lyrics are somewhat poetic but lack clarity and direct relevance to the prompt, making them difficult to relate to the specific emotional and contextual needs described. The overall coherence of the lyrics is moderate as they maintain a consistent abstract and introspective tone, but they do not clearly convey a straightforward narrative or emotion."

The emotional alignment is low as the song conveys a sense of movement and escape rather than the anxiety and confusion implied by the user's prompt. Contextually, the song's theme of travel and movement does not align well with the static, tense situation of waiting for an exam. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear narrative or detailed imagery that directly connects with the user's emotional state. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."

The repeated references to the blue sky, green leaves, and the warmth of the sun align well with the user's emotional state, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song fits the theme of a bright, hopeful day, though its whimsical tone and the use of playful, nonsensical words like 'shpadoinkle' might slightly deviate from a straightforward interpretation of the prompt, hence the slightly lower score. The lyrical coherence is moderate; while the song maintains a cheerful and light-hearted narrative, the quirky language and repetition might make the lyrics seem a bit disjointed or confusing to some listeners."
Saw my app featured on the store’s front page—cheeks hurt from smiling.,i stopped off at the grocery store to pick up a few things and i was reaching for some cheerios when i heard someone say my name i knew exactly who it was my heart started to race i turned around my legs got weak when i saw her face there stood the girl that broke my heart just a year ago i thought that i was over her but little did i know that running into her like that would leave me in a total mess wishing that we never said goodbye and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she ran over and hugged my neck i didn t want her to let go she smiled and said i looked just like a kid with my box of cheerios we laughed and talked about old times which wasn t all that smart cause it just left me with an emptiness when she pushed away her cart and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she walked away looked back and smiled clean up on aisle five,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of happiness and pride from seeing their app featured. The song's narrative focuses on a melancholic encounter with an ex-lover in a grocery store, which contrasts sharply with the user's joyful experience. The context of the song, centered around a chance meeting and unresolved feelings, is also unrelated to the user's situation of professional achievement. The lyrics themselves are coherent and tell a clear story, but they do not match the user's emotional or contextual needs."
Spent half an hour cursing the remote control until I realised I was pointing it at the wrong TV box—light-bulb moment.,i know i can never make up my mind half the time im sick just tryna find a straight light and i thought i saw the light behind your glassy narrow eyes fall fell and the weight came crashing down half the year i spent trying to relieve myself and i thought your hands were warmth something to fix my freezing form but i soon realized again it was just poor circulation and i thought i saw the light behind your glassy narrow eyes but i soon found it to be brewin slowly inside of me,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of frustration and realization, which aligns to some extent with the user's emotion of irritation followed by a light-bulb moment. However, the song's theme of personal struggle and introspection diverges significantly from the light-hearted, slightly comedic nature of the user's situation involving a remote control and a TV box. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but tend to be repetitive and somewhat disjointed, making it harder to follow a clear narrative or message. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual prompt, as it leans more towards a serious tone rather than capturing the amusing realization in the user's experience."
The vet said the tests are normal—I can finally breathe again.,i thought i found myself today no one s noticed things are okay i took a walk down the street found nothing beneath my feet i feel safest in knowing that i am true when i look in your eyes the idea of you put me on a food stamp and a hallmark card tranquilize me with your ideal world i was taught what to believe now i m only certain that no one is free tranquilize me with your ideal world,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of relief and self-discovery, aligning well with the user's emotional state of finally being able to breathe again after receiving good news from the vet. This scores a 4 in emotional alignment. However, the context of the song, which delves into personal introspection and societal commentary, does not closely match the specific scenario of relief related to a pet's health, thus scoring a 2 in contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat abstract and disjointed, which might make them less directly coherent, scoring a 3 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song captures the emotional essence but does not perfectly fit the user's specific context."
"I laughed at his idea during the meeting, and guilt’s eating at me now.",i keep on laughing and you re keeping track and tonight i ll go back to the place i first knew that i d wait for you always on streets and in doorways where engines they die near the northeastern line and you mentioned a record that reminded me of a week that you couldn t get things out of your head i m truly sorry i missed that night it could have been the best time but it s just timing she showed up unexpected and i the train into town i put my collar down and pushed through the door but if it s smiles you want talk to the kid with the boy eyes and wake up dreaming next to him,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of regret and missed opportunities, which aligns to some extent with the user's feeling of guilt. However, the song's narrative about missed connections and reminiscing about past interactions does not directly address the specific context of feeling guilty about laughing at someone's idea in a professional setting. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and difficult to follow, lacking a clear and coherent narrative structure. This makes it harder for the song to effectively convey a focused emotional or contextual message related to the user's prompt."

However, the song's themes of personal distress and disillusionment with life do not directly reflect the specific scenario of missing someone at a café, hence the low score in contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves, while evocative, are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making them moderately coherent but not entirely clear or directly relevant to the user's described situation."
Walked into the living room and everyone yelled “welcome back!”—did not see that coming.,letra de radioactive de imagine dragons bely basarte cover i m waking up to ash and dust i wipe my brow and i sweat my rust i m breathing in the chemicals i m breaking in shaping up then checking out on the prison bus this is it the apocalypse whoa i m waking up i feel it in my bones enough to make my systems blow welcome to the new age to the new age welcome to the new age to the new age whoa whoa i m radioactive radioactive whoa whoa i m radioactive radioactive i raise my flags don my clothes it s a revolution i suppose we re painted red to fit right in whoa i m breaking in shaping up then checking out on the prison bus this is it the apocalypse whoa i m waking up i feel it in my bones enough to make my systems blow welcome to the new age to the new age welcome to the new age to the new age  whoa whoa i m radioactive radioactive whoa whoa i m radioactive radioactive all systems go the sun hasn t died deep in my bones straight from inside i m waking up i feel it in my bones enough to make my systems blow welcome to the new age to the new age welcome to the new age to the new age whoa whoa i m radioactive radioactive whoa whoa i m radioactive radioactive,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,"The song 'Radioactive' by Imagine Dragons, as covered by Bely Basarte, primarily deals with themes of transformation and awakening in a new, perhaps dystopian world. The emotional alignment with the user's prompt of a surprising and joyful 'welcome back' is minimal, as the song conveys a more intense and possibly ominous tone, rather than a light-hearted or joyful surprise. Contextually, the song also does not align well with the scenario of entering a room to a warm, unexpected welcome, as it discusses themes of revolution and change in a broader, more abstract sense. The lyrical coherence of the song is strong, with clear and impactful lyrics that convey the intended themes effectively. However, the overall match to the user's prompt is low due to the significant mismatch in both emotional and contextual aspects."
Seeing my younger cousin nail her first piano solo blew me away.,wow you know christmas time is coming now baby tell me though santa claus gone come to you wow you know christmas time is coming now tell me though santa claus gone come to you you know i m gone send him my step daughter and bring you a present and do a little thing that you may want me to yeah you know i went down main street in new york city ol santa claus had a belt in his hand yes you know i went down new york city i saw santa claus he was standing down with a belt ringing in his hand why you know the poor children was running up hollering you gone come to me santy and he said lil girl please put something on santys hand wow and i happend to see these old people learning the young ones yeah just learning them exactly what to do so sweet it s so sweet to see these old people learning they old children just what to do mother said a million year ago santa claus come to me now this year he gone come to you my little sister said take your stocking now hang it up on the head of the bed talkin to her friend she said take your stocking and please hang it up on head of the bed and she said know we all god s saint children in the morning ol santa claus gone see that we all is fed ,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song primarily focuses on the theme of Christmas and Santa Claus, which does not align with the user's emotional experience of witnessing a family member's musical achievement. Emotional alignment is low because the song's festive, anticipatory emotions around Christmas do not reflect the pride and amazement described in the prompt. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it discusses holiday themes rather than a personal or musical milestone. Lyrical coherence is slightly better, as the lyrics maintain a consistent theme about Christmas and interactions with Santa Claus, though the narrative is somewhat disjointed and repetitive. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."

However, the song's focus on immigration and authority issues dilutes its relevance to the specific context of airline service and lost luggage. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, telling a clear story about rejection and blame, but they do not directly address the user's emotional state of feeling trivialized by a service provider. Overall, the song captures a general sense of frustration but misses the mark in directly addressing the user's specific situation and emotions."

The user's prompt indicates a focus on a repetitive, mundane issue (a dripping tap) causing distraction and possibly irritation. The song lyrics, however, delve into broader, more complex themes involving pollution, political commentary, and personal relationships, which do not directly relate to the simplicity and specificity of the user's situation. Additionally, the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making it difficult to find a coherent narrative or clear connection to the user's focus on a dripping tap. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional or contextual needs, and the lyrics lack clarity and direct relevance to the user's described situation."
My roommate finally started rinsing the dishes instead of piling them up—honestly proud of that progress.,yo listen i met this girl on baltic ave you can tell how she steps on boardwalk she was from park place i asked what she was doing on this side of town she said she had some taxes to pay i figured i d take a chance and advance to go and find out more about her cause there s more to know than the ways she sways and the way that she wears her clothes or the way that she plays this game so cold she said she came up rough and the one income household was not enough there d be nights she d go to sleep cold and hungry cause her mom was always short on food and money see people used to joke a lot and tease her bout her clothes not being in style dressed in dingy skirts and dirty sneakers from the finest second hand down on oriental ave but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she s got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly once she graduated jr high she started working overtime scrubbing floors or working on assembly lines just so she could help her mother out and after college they moved into marvin s garden and she got a job working at the city water department to save enough cash to move into community chest condos on pennsylvania ave she fell in love with this dude name ray who was a small time hustler from st charles place and he was known for always being in and out of trouble but the problem was that he was never on her level she argued with her mom about ray s work till he got sent upstate on the same say that she gave birth but see the baby never made it it drove her nearly crazy and she couldn t take it  but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she s got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly listen see where she came from many people find it hard just to hang on you often find them in the same place complaining instead of finding a better way of maintaining she could have balled up and cried and wished that she would die and just gave up on trying instead she grind from the bottom just to make it to the bottom now she s on top and she s flying but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly womanopoly yeah she s got it whoa yeah alright ,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's narrative of overcoming hardship and achieving control over one's life loosely aligns with the theme of personal improvement mentioned in the user's prompt about their roommate's progress. However, the emotional tone and context of the song, which deals with significant life struggles and societal issues, is much more intense and complex compared to the relatively mundane and light-hearted situation of a roommate starting to rinse dishes. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story, but they do not closely match the specific context or light emotional tone of the user's situation."
Spent half the night checking on my pup’s fever; I’m dead tired but can’t leave his side.,you know i m tired i got a fevered brow you know i d change if i were with her now you gave me drugs you said d cure my ills they may cure yours but mine are with me still if i were with her now if i were with her now if i were with her now,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's mention of 'tired' and 'fevered brow' aligns well with the user's emotional state of exhaustion and concern for their feverish pup, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on themes of illness and a desire for presence ('if I were with her now'), which loosely connects to the user's situation of staying by their sick pup's side, though the song's focus on a human relationship dilutes the fit. The lyrics, while somewhat repetitive and abstract, maintain a basic coherence but could be clearer in conveying a consistent narrative or theme."

The lyrics focus on a repetitive and personal call to someone, which does not reflect the awe or curiosity about a natural phenomenon like glowing plankton. The context of the song is more about personal longing or searching for someone, which is unrelated to the scientific or natural world curiosity expressed in the user's prompt. The lyrics are somewhat coherent in terms of structure but lack depth and relevance to the topic, leading to a low score in lyrical coherence."
All morning I’ve been day-dreaming about escaping to a quiet cabin in the woods—can almost smell the pine.,from the cape to the hook with a carpet of leaves underfoot through the lakes and the pines with my nose and my ears and eyes and with the warm sun on my shoulders and with the river rushing down i m walking on a path to higher ground out of the trees and through the clouds down the fence in the dusk through the scree at the foot of the bluff and i drank from the brook and i slept in the lee of the wood and in the house where i last held you our bed was cast adrift all night and you were taking me to higher ground out of my skin above the clouds and in the canvas of a clear night a billion pins of flickering light and i dreamed of rising up beside you among the galaxies and stars and you were taking me to higher ground out of my skin above the clouds,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,"The song lyrics strongly resonate with the user's desire to escape to a natural setting, specifically mentioning elements like 'lakes', 'pines', 'river', and 'wood', which align well with the user's daydream about a cabin in the woods. The emotional tone of seeking solace and elevation ('higher ground') in nature matches the user's longing for a peaceful retreat. However, the lyrics are somewhat fragmented and jump between different scenes and thoughts, which slightly reduces their coherence. Overall, the song is a good match for the user's emotional and contextual needs, providing a vivid and thematically relevant narrative."

The lyrics convey a sense of unease and dissatisfaction, which mirrors the user's emotional state. However, the song's context is more abstract and less directly related to the specific scenario of preparing for an event that was cancelled. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and lack clear fluency, making it difficult to fully grasp the narrative or thematic connection beyond the general feeling of disappointment. Overall, the song resonates emotionally but struggles with clarity and direct relevance to the specific context of an open-mic night."

However, the song's focus on media and societal issues does not directly address the specific context of littering in cinemas, leading to a low score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent theme of dissatisfaction with external influences, but they do not directly address the user's specific concern about cleanliness and respect in public spaces."

The lyrics emphasize themes of being in the spotlight, the thrill of the moment, and readiness to seize the opportunity, which aligns well with the emotions of attending a significant event like a final game or show. The context of preparation and celebration in the song matches the user's situation of attending a high-energy, important event. The lyrics are mostly coherent and fluently convey the excitement, though some repetitive phrases slightly affect the lyrical depth. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's emotional state and context."
Walking past that abandoned lot at night makes my pulse race.,and 6 am in morningside the first car rushes by we walk down to the garden and the sunlight fills your eyes and stops me for a moment till i turn and look the other way the windows are all open and it s saturday and where i ride the evening turns to blue and fades away a silence hangs enchanted through sunset and the lane the air is charged with sunlight and your name is ringing through my mind cathedral bells and sunlit is the night,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not strongly align with the user's emotional state of feeling a racing pulse while walking past an abandoned lot at night. The song's mood is more serene and reflective, focusing on peaceful morning scenes and enchanting sunsets, which contrasts with the user's sense of anxiety and fear. Contextually, the song mentions walking and environments, but it does not capture the eerie or unsettling atmosphere of an abandoned lot at night. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, with a flowing narrative about moments and scenes, though they lack a clear connection to the user's described scenario."

The lyrics emphasize the joy and positive impact of simple gestures, like smiling or sharing a song, aligning well with the emotional tone of the prompt. Contextually, the song fits as it discusses spreading happiness and kindness, similar to the stranger's act in the prompt. However, it doesn't directly reference the specific scenario of juggling items, making it slightly less contextually relevant. The lyrics are coherent and fluently convey the message of sharing joy and kindness, enhancing the overall thematic connection to the prompt."

The repeated references to enjoying life, drinking wine, and celebrating the sun contribute to this alignment, scoring a 4 for emotional alignment. Contextually, the song mentions nature and the outdoors, which loosely connects to the user growing tomatoes on a balcony, earning a score of 3. However, the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and chaotic, with a focus on drinking and partying that doesn't directly relate to the simple joy of gardening, leading to a coherence score of 2. Overall, the song captures the spirit of celebration but could be more focused and relevant to the specific context of gardening."

The mention of keeping a favorite scene and a photograph close aligns with the theme of cherishing a personal, visual memory, similar to the doodled sketch. However, the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear, coherent narrative, which might make it harder for the listener to fully connect with the song's message. The overall score reflects a good emotional and contextual match but is brought down by the lyrical coherence."

However, the context of the song, which seems to revolve around an intense, possibly romantic scenario, does not align well with the mundane and specific situation of waiting at the dentist, scoring a 1 for contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and disjointed, lacking clear narrative or fluency, resulting in a coherence score of 1. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs in this scenario."
"Got a rejection email, yet somehow I feel the next interview will click.",when i look at you i m probably the same way too i got a feeling that it s coming soon could this be the end and when i look around this room it must be something i can do can i convince you that it isn t true we ve come to the end oh did i disappoint you i wanted to believe it s true oh the book of love was not enough to see us through the problem should ve been you should ve been you should ve been you should ve been you if it hadn t been me should ve been you should ve been you should ve been you if it hadn t been me it seems so obvious to you you re feeling what i m feeling too the final chapter in the contract expires soon we ve come to the end thank god i m not the same as you you always know exactly what to do is who i am is not for you we ve come to the end oh did i disappoint you i wanted to believe it s true oh the book of love was not enough to see us through  the problem should ve been you should ve been you should ve been you if it hadn t been me should ve been you should ve been you if it hadn t been me would ve been you should ve been you if it hadn t been me if it hadn t been me if it hadn t been me if it hadn t been me if it hadn t been me3,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song's emotional tone of regret and blame does not align well with the user's mixed feelings of disappointment from a rejection and optimism for future opportunities, scoring low on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song focuses on a failing relationship, which is not relevant to the user's situation regarding job interviews, hence a low score on contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and focus heavily on blame, which might not provide the motivational or empathetic support needed, leading to a moderate score on lyrical coherence."
Ran my first 5 k without stopping; pretty pleased with myself.,damn i feel good i might be a little too high girl damn i look good i might be a little too fly yeah i got money in my pocket i got a drink in my hand i feel like nothing can stop me damn i feel like the man i m on top of the world,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The recommended song lyrics align well with the user's emotion of feeling pleased and accomplished, as the lyrics express a strong sense of confidence and self-satisfaction ('damn i feel good', 'i feel like nothing can stop me', 'i'm on top of the world'). This matches the user's pride in completing their first 5k run. However, the contextual relevance is slightly lower because the lyrics focus more on general feelings of success and self-celebration rather than specifically relating to running or physical achievement. The lyrics are coherent and maintain a consistent theme of self-confidence and enjoyment, which makes them easy to understand and relate to within the context of celebrating personal achievements."
"Realised the meeting invite said 7 a.m., not p.m.—no wonder no one joined.",i asked you a question but i didn t need you to reply is it gettin heavy but then i realized is it gettin heavy well i thought it was already as heavy as can be is it overwhelming to use a crane to crush a fly it s a good time for superman to lift the sun into the sky cause it s gettin heavy well i thought it was already as heavy as can be tell everybody waitin for superman that they should try to hold on best they can he hasn t dropped them forgot them or anything it s just too heavy for superman to lift is it gettin heavy well i thought it was already as heavy as can be tell everybody waitin for superman that they should try to hold on best they can he hasn t dropped them forgot them or anything it s just too heavy for superman to lift,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song lyrics discuss themes of heaviness and being overwhelmed, which could loosely connect to the user's feeling of confusion and surprise upon realizing the meeting time error. However, the emotional alignment is weak as the song's focus on 'heaviness' and 'waiting for Superman' does not directly reflect the user's likely emotions of frustration or amusement at the mix-up. Contextually, the song does not specifically address issues related to scheduling, meetings, or time misunderstandings, making it a poor fit for the user's scenario. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear, coherent narrative, which impacts their overall fluency and sense."
The lights flicked back on as soon as the storm ended—felt like exhaling.,and the waves just hang rushing again and just splashing on the rocks sort of sort of a spacial experience that ,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The recommended song lyrics seem to capture a sense of natural phenomena, similar to the storm mentioned in the prompt. However, the emotional alignment is weak as the lyrics focus more on the ongoing action of waves and lack a direct connection to the feeling of relief or release described as 'exhaling' after the storm. Contextually, the lyrics are somewhat relevant because they describe a natural setting, but they do not specifically address the aftermath of a storm or the restoration of calm and light. The lyrical coherence is low; the lyrics are fragmented and lack fluency, making it difficult to derive a clear and impactful message."

The user's prompt reflects a sense of emptiness and transition after packing away holiday decorations, which suggests a mood of quiet reflection or subtle melancholy. However, the song lyrics describe chaotic and intense scenes involving drug use and erratic behavior, which contrasts sharply with the user's situation. The song's context of urban disarray and personal turmoil is irrelevant to the user's experience of a simple, domestic change. The lyrics themselves, while vivid and expressive, are somewhat disjointed and difficult to follow, which affects their coherence. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional or contextual needs."

The lyrics emphasize movement, travel, and the unexpected turns of life, which resonates with the emotion of excitement and spontaneity found in the prompt (scored 4). Contextually, the song is a perfect match as it discusses traveling across cities and the experiences on the road, directly reflecting the theme of a road trip (scored 5). The lyrical coherence is moderate; while the song's narrative is clear and thematic, the stream-of-consciousness style and the lack of punctuation can make the lyrics slightly harder to follow (scored 3). Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's emotional and contextual needs, providing a fitting backdrop for the beginning of an unexpected journey."

This earns it a high score in emotional alignment. However, the song's context of Christmas and a comedic family scenario only partially matches the user's experience of watching a comedy movie, leading to a moderate score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive but maintain a clear narrative, resulting in an average score for lyrical coherence. Overall, the song could enhance the user's cheerful mood post-movie, but its specific holiday theme might not fully resonate with the general comedic experience."
"I just returned to my desk and found my meticulously organized files shredded and scattered everywhere, and I was absolutely furious.",don t forget i know where you come from i watched it all your every change from nothing to something so fast you never had a chance to learn a thing and there s so many just like you and it s always the same forever ends before it began and now it s yourself that you hate spit my rage in your face spit my rage and those so quick to judge with a mouthful of shit you feed to everyone lost in contradiction now it s yourself that you can t live with spit my rage in your face spit my rage in your face cut back down to size lost in your own lies i ll spit spit my fucking rage in your face spit my rage in your face spit my rage in your fucking face,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.7,"The song's lyrics strongly reflect the emotion of fury, aligning perfectly with the user's feeling of being 'absolutely furious' upon discovering their destroyed files. This earns a score of 5 for emotional alignment. However, the context of the song, which seems to address personal betrayal and confrontation, only partially matches the user's situation of dealing with an act of vandalism or sabotage at work, resulting in a score of 2 for contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are repetitive and somewhat disjointed, focusing more on expressing rage than forming a coherent narrative or argument, which leads to a low coherence score of 1. Overall, while the song captures the intensity of the user's anger, its relevance and lyrical clarity are limited."
The neighbor's car alarm blaring at sunrise grated on my nerves and ruined my morning.,i heard a knocking on my front door in the middle of the night on this abandoned road this lonely home i see the lighting of the figure in the pale moonlight she said come with me come with me this dark purple sky let s set it ablaze ablaze light up the night i wanna set it ablaze ablaze i heard the footsteps coming like a freight train all through the town there s no time to be a lookout so don t put that ear to the ground it s a cold hard world just waiting for some changes there s no one left except for you and i i m so sick and tired of the colors always fading in this dark purple sky let s set it ablaze set it ablaze colors always fading,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.67,"The song lyrics focus on a mysterious and somewhat ominous scenario involving a late-night visitor and a desire to 'set it ablaze,' which metaphorically could relate to changing or disrupting a current state. However, the emotional alignment with the user's prompt is low; the song does not reflect the irritation and disruption caused by a car alarm early in the morning. Contextually, the song also scores low as it does not relate to the specific scenario of a neighborhood disturbance or the mundane frustration of a ruined morning. The lyrics themselves, while somewhat coherent and creating a vivid scene, do not directly address or resonate with the user's expressed feelings or situation. The overall score reflects these mismatches, despite the lyrics being moderately coherent in their own narrative."
"After staying up all night finishing that report, hearing my manager praise my work in the morning convinced me i’d made the right call.",that s the way we spell success,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The recommended song lyrics 'that's the way we spell success' align well emotionally with the user's feeling of validation and accomplishment after receiving praise from their manager. This captures the sense of triumph and affirmation. However, the context of the song is somewhat relevant but not fully detailed or specific to the scenario of working hard all night on a report. The lyrics themselves are very brief and lack fluency or depth, which makes the lyrical coherence score lower. Overall, the song captures the essence of success but does not deeply explore the nuances of the user's experience or provide a rich lyrical narrative."
"My brother felt terrible all night, so I stayed by his side and made sure he had everything he needed.",your silhouette is on the door the subtle steps the creaking floor you came to hold me in the dark to soothe the searing pain that sealed this coat of arms you came across my weathered home the walls were blank but still were warm careful with your light now brother i have lost them all see that restless tide now coming down on you alone careful with your light now honey that i fear the most i carried it to bed and now its carrying you home careful with your light now brother i have lost them all see that restless tide now coming down on you alone careful with your light now honey that i fear the most i carried it to bed and now its carrying you home with these peaceful ghosts,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of care and emotional support, aligning well with the user's experience of comforting their brother, hence scoring high on emotional alignment. The context of being by someone's side in a time of need is somewhat captured, though the song's references to 'restless tide' and 'peaceful ghosts' introduce themes that are not directly relevant to the user's situation, leading to a moderate score in contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat abstract and repetitive, which might make it difficult for some listeners to follow or find direct relevance in their situation, resulting in a lower score in lyrical coherence."
Receiving an urgent call from my doctor asking me to come in immediately without any details left me completely uncertain about what was wrong.,you were my heart but i am older now and i don t know how i don t know how i don t know if we ll meet again if we ll meet again if we ll meet again i tried so hard because i m older now but i don t know how i don t know how i don t know if this will ever end if this will ever end if this will ever end,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.67,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of uncertainty and confusion, which aligns with the user's emotional state after receiving an ambiguous and urgent call from the doctor. This earns a score of 3 for emotional alignment. However, the context of the song, which seems to deal more with personal or relational uncertainty rather than a health-related issue, only partially matches the user's situation, resulting in a score of 2 for contextual relevance. The lyrics, while repetitive and somewhat vague, maintain a consistent theme and are understandable, leading to a coherence score of 3. Overall, the song partially captures the user's emotional and contextual state but may not fully resonate due to its different thematic focus."
I just uncovered a major secret hidden in the archives and can’t stop wondering what else I’ll find.,you arrest me with a word i m comatose oh you bested me in our silent mental war have you ever felt the sting of surprise oh my wait til you see see the light that enlightened me you injected me how i long for one more dose oh you rescued me from my internal tug of war have you ever felt the sting of goodbye oh my wait til you see see the light that enlighted me set me free set me free set me free set me free 2,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of discovery and enlightenment, which aligns moderately with the user's emotion of curiosity and wonder after uncovering a secret. However, the song seems to focus more on personal liberation and internal conflict rather than the thrill of uncovering secrets or historical revelations, which affects its contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and abstract, making it difficult to fully grasp a coherent narrative or clear message, which impacts the lyrical coherence score."
I just watched that cooking show and I’m longing to try making that chocolate soufflé tonight.,wish i was cooking mexicali dreaming in the valley stuck in snow filled cities where all the girls are pretty sipping whiskey in nevada peeping at the mamas swimming in the water making music cause i want it now music cause i want it now ooh champagne with my papi just another badi parked outside the theater too faded to see either pull up to eleven munchies till we seven am in the morning making music cause i want it now music cause i want it now ooh this is where i want to be when feeling down can you feel the energy in this place in this town2,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song does not align well with the user's emotional state of excitement and anticipation about cooking a specific dish, chocolate soufflé. The lyrics mention cooking but in a different context ('cooking mexicali'), which does not match the user's culinary focus. The song's themes of traveling, partying, and music-making diverge significantly from the user's interest in a cooking endeavor. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, with a clear depiction of various scenarios, but they lack a consistent narrative or theme that ties directly back to the user's cooking experience. Overall, the song does not effectively resonate with the user's current emotional and contextual state."
"I opened the email to see that tonight’s concert had been canceled, leaving me utterly let down.",well i got caught in traffic and it made me miss my flight my flight and they aren t gonna have another one till tomorrow night that s right i m runnin for the train cuz i m late for work again oh no and the door slam shut just before i can get in i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it i was born too late so i never got to see jimmy hendrix he s dead i was born too late so i never got to meet sid vicious he s dead i was born too late so i never got to see ziggy stardust oh no i was born too late so i never got to see t rex i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it i missed a ride i missed a plane i missed a light i missed a train missed my sister missed my period missed my mother missed my father missed my boyfriend missed my girlfriend i missed my period because i missed it missed it because i missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it born too late born too late ,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song captures a sense of frustration and disappointment, which aligns somewhat with the user's feeling of being 'let down' due to the concert cancellation. However, the song's focus on missing various events and opportunities, while thematically related, doesn't specifically address the emotional depth or specific context of a canceled concert. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack a coherent narrative, which might make it difficult for the user to find solace or a deeper connection to their specific situation. The repeated phrase 'I missed it' does resonate with the theme of missing out, but the overall coherence of the lyrics is low, affecting the song's ability to fully engage with the user's emotional state."
"I just found out the community center canceled the free cooking classes without telling me, and it felt unfair that they didn’t ask for my opinion.",everyone s just looking for a reason to go on but every time i turn around i feel that you are gone and i know from my mistake before i should have seen the truth do it one more time and it ll be my fault for trusting you could i ever trust the words you say still trying to say that i can t forget what you did no way wasting my time trying my patience but i can t forget what you did no way everyone s just looking for a person whom to trust but every time i turn around i feel that you are lost ignored what felt so wrong to just play the fool once again gave up on feelings strong and buried them it seems so pointless,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"The song reflects a sense of betrayal and disappointment, which aligns with the user's feelings of being treated unfairly. However, the context of the song, which seems to focus more on personal relationships and trust issues, only partially matches the user's situation regarding a community event. The lyrics are coherent and express clear sentiments, though they are more suited to interpersonal trust rather than community or organizational trust."
"I just took a bite of my sandwich and realized it had gone bad, making my stomach turn.",it was over and i felt a hand run over my head and the wind came and it brought me to the surface of the sand and i realize that you are here to help me understand i have a brother they were after us the walls are gone the pipes are hanging all the money left and you were lost and we were hiding so i take this time a time to breathe for all the days they re gone to find another only this now only this now spit at the sea we move to something new only when we want to alone on the sea that mothered me,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the user's emotional and contextual prompt. The user's experience is one of immediate discomfort and disgust, which is not reflected in the song's themes of overcoming adversity and moving forward. The song's context, involving themes of escape, survival, and reflection, does not relate to the simple, everyday scenario of eating a spoiled sandwich. Additionally, the lyrical coherence is low, as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making it difficult to derive a clear and consistent narrative or emotional thread that could relate to the user's experience."
I just waved enthusiastically at someone who wasn’t waving at me and wanted to disappear on the spot.,hang that wreath so i can have a happy new year you re so pretty people envy you can you tie a tie you re the reason children turn to dope pour my drink so we can have ourselves a good time you re the reason people lose their minds when they re all around you and you don t know what you ve done,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the user's emotional state of embarrassment and the desire to disappear. The lyrics seem to focus on a mix of admiration and blame towards another person, which does not reflect the self-consciousness or awkwardness described in the prompt. The context of the song, which appears to be about the influence of a person on others, is also not relevant to the user's situation of a simple social mishap. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear narrative or connection between the ideas presented, making it difficult to grasp a unified theme or message. Overall, the song does not effectively address or resonate with the user's emotional and contextual needs."
I just found out my best friend is flying in for a surprise visit and I can’t stop smiling.,wake up and i greet the sun feel like this is gonna be my special one my idea of fun to be at the right place at the right time celestial surprise before your eyes impossible is nothing,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics reflect a positive and uplifting mood, aligning well with the user's emotion of happiness and excitement about a surprise visit from a best friend. The mention of a 'celestial surprise' and 'impossible is nothing' resonates with the unexpected and joyful nature of the user's situation. However, the song's context of greeting the sun and feeling like it's a special day, while positive, is not directly about friendship or reunions, which slightly lowers its contextual relevance. The lyrics are coherent and flow well, contributing to an overall good match for the user's prompt."
"I just got word my friend is driving here through this raging thunderstorm, and each crack of thunder sent a chill down my spine.",mass hysteria moved from pyramids ride the wheels so high into the sky,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The recommended song lyrics do not align well with the user's emotional state of worry and anxiety about their friend driving through a thunderstorm. The mention of 'mass hysteria' and 'high into the sky' could vaguely connect to the intensity of a storm, but it lacks direct relevance to the specific concern for safety and the atmospheric tension described. The lyrics are also somewhat abstract and disjointed, making them difficult to relate directly to the user's situation or to understand in a coherent narrative context."

"I just found my grandmother’s favorite shawl tucked in her chair, and tears welled up as I remembered her warmth.",the boy s mother came to his room and found him sitting at his window i found the dusty rainbow he said i found it in my crates his mother smiled yes love you found your dusty rainbow from the dark years have passed the boy has grown but he hasn t forgotten his mother s story and his discovery those days are behind him now and his life s song is in its last course now in happiness and sadness he goes back to his records to dig in the wax to dig for the dusty rainbow from the dark,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"The song's emotional tone of nostalgia and reminiscence aligns moderately well with the user's feelings of remembering a loved one, scoring a 3 for emotional alignment. However, the context of the song, which revolves around a boy and his mother discussing a past discovery, only partially matches the user's experience of finding a personal item of a deceased loved one, thus scoring a 2 for contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are quite coherent and tell a clear story, earning a 4 for lyrical coherence. Overall, the song moderately addresses the user's emotional state and context but may not fully capture the specific connection to the grandmother's memory."
"I opened my inbox this morning to find I’d received my scholarship award, and I can’t stop grinning from ear to ear.",we pried open my window and let the summer rush in and we laughed with the new air now i lay and watch the green leaves dance and whisper sweet breath a promise of a new year ooh on this day ooh on this day we were born into the new year and after the winter broke we held hands and we ran and we agreed that it had been a long one ooh on this day ooh on this day we were born into the new year ooh on this day ooh on this day we were born into the new year,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of renewal and joy, which aligns partially with the user's emotion of happiness upon receiving a scholarship. However, the context of the song, which seems to focus on the change of seasons and a sense of starting anew, does not directly relate to the achievement or academic context of the user's prompt. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent theme of renewal and joy, but they do not directly address the user's specific situation of receiving a scholarship, leading to a moderate overall score."
"I woke up this morning to find a bouquet of flowers on my nightstand with a note that said ‘just because’, and my heart melted.",yesterday was not just another day not like before yesterday i saw your smiling face love walked through my door one precious moment changed my life one tender kiss made everything right one touch from you and this world was mine it was in your arms where i found forever cried my first tears of joy last night heaven shined a light all my dreams came true my first night with you i felt the sun shine so bright on me chased the rain from my heart through the storm through the darkest night i found my brightest star one precious moment changed my life one tender kiss made everything right one touch from you and this world was mine it was in your arms where i found forever cried my first tears of joy last night heaven shined a light all my dreams came true my first night with you one touch from you and this world was mine it was in your arms babe where i found forever and ever cried my first tears of joy last night heaven shined a light all my dreams came true my first night with you1,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a deep emotional connection and joy similar to the user's experience of receiving a surprise bouquet, which evokes feelings of being loved and cherished. The emotional alignment is high as both the song and the prompt share themes of unexpected joy and love. However, the contextual relevance is slightly lower because the song seems to focus more on a romantic first night together, which is a bit more specific and intense than the simple act of receiving flowers. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express the emotions of love and joy, making them easy to follow and understand."
"I just sat down to record my podcast and realized I hadn’t rehearsed my opening lines, and I felt my palms grow clammy.",i realised my fists were clenched i stretched my fingers to relax still not sleeping i tried counting sheep one by one they leapt across the fence constructed for them right to left across the fence i had constructed having jumped they refused further direction each sheep where it landed refusing to exit remained try as i might i could not stop them entering once again try as they might not one could leave the stage i realised my fists were clenched i stretched my fingers each sheep were it landed refusing to exit remained try as they might not one could leave the stage try as i might i could not stop them entering once again no longer daring to close my eyes still not sleeping i realised my goose was cooked i wandered shipshaped on the shore,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of anxiety and tension, similar to the user's feeling of nervousness about not being prepared, which is why it scores a 2 in emotional alignment. However, the context of the song, which deals with insomnia and a repetitive, anxious thought process, doesn't align well with the specific scenario of recording a podcast, resulting in a score of 1 for contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and repetitive without a clear progression or resolution, making them hard to follow, thus scoring a 1 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs for their situation."
I just watched the sunrise break through the clouds and felt sure today would bring new opportunities.,i have so much anticipation for the future generation kids today grow up smart with open minds and open hearts we can do it we ll put our heads to it and then we ll be one family a world filled with racial stress but it seems every year less and less those old fashioned standards are going away tomorrow will be a brighter day we can do it we ll put our heads to it and then we ll be one family so if you agree and want to help first you must look inside yourself because unity begins with just us two then we ll watch it spread to all of you we can do it we ll put our heads to it and then we ll be one family ,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics reflect a hopeful and optimistic outlook, aligning well with the user's emotional state after witnessing a promising sunrise. The anticipation for a better future and the emphasis on unity and progress in the song resonate with the feeling of new opportunities. However, the song's focus on broader societal changes and racial unity, while positive, is slightly less directly relevant to the personal and nature-centric context of the user's prompt. The lyrics are coherent and flow well, conveying a clear message of hope and collective effort."

However, the context of the song, which revolves around a casual, carefree day with activities like riding a bike, playing ball, and performing at a show, doesn't closely match the professional achievement context of the user's prompt (Contextual relevance: 2). The lyrics are somewhat coherent with a clear narrative flow, though the colloquial and casual language might detract from the clarity for some listeners (Lyrical coherence: 3). Overall, the song provides a good emotional match but lacks in specific contextual relevance, leading to an overall score of 3."
"I just found an old photo of my childhood home tucked away in a drawer, and it made me realize how far I’ve come.",old friends bookends solitaire for two til she was leaving i never really knew when i looked in her eyes i realized it was all when i looked in her eyes i realized there s a knock on the door then you re home forever more and now that you re here there is nothing to fear when i looked in her eyes i realized ,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the emotional or contextual prompt provided. The user's prompt reflects a nostalgic and introspective emotion, focusing on personal growth and memories tied to a childhood home. The song lyrics, however, seem to revolve around a relationship and personal realizations within that context, which does not directly relate to the theme of reminiscing about a childhood home or personal journey. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative, making them only moderately coherent. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional state or the context of their experience."
"I just got the call that my test results came back clear, and I felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders.",it seemed like i had run out of second chances and they sentenced me to die and i was just like a dead man walking i was running out of time but you came to me and opened my eyes you gave me a brand new life chorus i am innocent and i have been set free i no longer have chains around my feet and no matter where i go or what they say i am innocent many years have past since the day that i met you but your words are still the same and everytime i find myself with joy or sadness i am calling out your name cause you came to me and opened my eyes you gave to me a brand new life,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of relief and rejuvenation, which aligns well with the emotion of the user's prompt about feeling a huge weight lifted after receiving good news. The theme of being 'set free' and no longer having 'chains' metaphorically matches the user's experience of being freed from worry. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story of transformation and liberation, although the direct context of the song seems to be more about a broader spiritual or existential redemption rather than a specific medical or health-related clearance. This slight mismatch in the specific context of the song compared to the user's situation about medical test results slightly lowers the contextual relevance score."

However, the context in which the apologies are presented in the song is broader and includes various scenarios and behaviors that do not specifically relate to the user's situation of sending a harsh message to a friend. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack depth in exploring the emotions or consequences of the actions, which affects their coherence and relevance to the user's specific context."
"I just sat down for dinner and saw my father’s chair still empty, my heart ached and I can’t stop crying.",drinkin jameson thinking about what we could have had cause you know that nothing seems to help everything just makes me so damn sad i don t want to be anywhere else that i could be right now i ve made my bed with the things i ve said so now i ll go lay down i miss you but it s just part of our lives to miss the things we never had ,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics resonate strongly with the emotion of grief and loss, as reflected in the user's prompt about missing their father. The mention of missing 'the things we never had' aligns with the user's emotional state of longing and heartache. However, the song's context of drinking and reflecting might not perfectly align with the dinner setting described in the prompt, but it still fits the broader theme of coping with absence. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express the feelings of sadness and regret, making them relatable and understandable in the context of loss."
"I just discovered a heartfelt letter from my childhood friend tucked inside an old book, and I was completely caught off guard.",long ago and oh so far away there were dreams that i recall full of unicorns who loved to play behind my garden walls and the clouds would look like dragons tails as they moved across the sky and a tree could be the prince of whales and little girls could fly i remember every moment how it was to just be me and to my surprise i look through your eyes and once more i can see i remember living in between what was real and what was not neath a sky of blue and a field of green i long ago forgot i remember rabbits running late underneath my mothers fence and a singing cup and a talking plate who somehow both made sense i remember every moment i remember being free and to my surprise i look through your eyes and i remember me for somewhere deep inside me there s a girl from way back when she just needs your heart to guide me and make her see again i remember every moment how it was to just be me and to my surprise i look through your eyes and once more i can see,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"The recommended song lyrics effectively capture the nostalgic and introspective emotion elicited by the user's experience of finding a heartfelt letter from a childhood friend. The lyrics' references to childhood memories, imaginative play, and a sense of rediscovery align well with the emotional and contextual aspects of the user's prompt. The lyrics are coherent and fluently convey a journey back to childhood innocence and wonder, which mirrors the user's unexpected reconnection with their past. The overall score reflects a strong match in terms of emotional resonance, contextual relevance, and lyrical coherence, making it a suitable choice for the given scenario."
I really look up to my brother. I hope I can be like him one day.,i ve waited for this day for such a long time you are everything i ve waited for if memory says i might be disappointed cause a lifetime here with you will seem to short all i see is white that s coming towards me all i ve wanted you within my arms if it s required that i forsake all others i ll do that and more i ve waited for this day for such a long time i hope that i can be what you deserve i hope the days get longer and make this love grow stronger god will be the strength and our reason,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.67,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of anticipation and hope, which aligns moderately well with the user's emotional expression of admiration and aspiration towards their brother. However, the song's context seems to be more about a romantic or deeply personal relationship rather than a familial one, which reduces its contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, expressing a clear desire and commitment, though they are slightly vague and repetitive, impacting the overall fluency and sense of the lyrics."
I watched this concert today and couldn’t stop laughing and smiling. It just made me feel so light and entertained.,let s sit here in the breakdown lane let s ohh and ahh until the show stops the way it makes your face light up let s have a show of hands who s enjoying themselves i know i am,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The recommended song captures the emotional essence of the user's experience at the concert, particularly the joy and entertainment aspects, as reflected in the lyrics about enjoying oneself and faces lighting up. This aligns well with the user's feelings of laughter and smiles, scoring a 4 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song mentions a 'show' and the enjoyment of it, which loosely connects to the user's experience of watching a concert, earning a score of 3. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat disjointed and lacks fluency, making it harder to fully grasp the narrative or thematic continuity, resulting in a score of 2. Overall, the song moderately suits the user's described experience but could be improved in lyrical clarity."
I’m honestly so mad right now. I trusted someone again and they hurt me—how can people keep doing this?,this is the way we lived these words are meaningless and everything there reminds me of these days after all that we ve built it s unfair everything that we loved is away and after all we ve done why do i feel like you can t bring it back home and after all we ve done i need to know on my own i can t feel anything else anymore on my own oh this fucking pain goes on where are we today are we blind or honest liars or affraid after all that we ve built it s unfair everything that we loved is away and after all we ve done why do i feel like you can t bring it back home and after all we ve done i can see the breath of my mistakes can you feel the pulses on my chest where are we today are we blind or honest liars or affraid are we walking on the same way on my own i still can feel this pain these words are meaningless and after all we ve done like you can t bring it back home,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song chosen aligns well with the user's emotional state of anger and betrayal, as it expresses feelings of pain and disappointment after trust has been broken, which is reflected in lines like 'after all that we've built it's unfair' and 'I can see the breath of my mistakes.' However, the song's context is more about personal introspection and the aftermath of a fallout, which only partially matches the user's focus on being hurt by someone else's actions. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and disjointed, which affects their overall coherence and might make it harder for the user to find a clear, relatable message."
"There’s this person I deal with regularly, and the way he speaks just really irritates me. I don’t know why it gets to me so much.",i m so frustrated some things are making me so sick inside aw go with your heart go with your heart yeah right quit tugging me aw i m just not good enough for you let s change let s be something we re not let s be something everybody else is ah so much built up inside it s fucking ridiculous i don t know if i should freak the fuck out on you or just sit back and laugh you want more you don t have anything me me i have everything yeah i have everything what more could i ask for nothing at all why did it have to be this way at the end why did it have to be this way at the end 1,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics score highly on emotional alignment as they express frustration and irritation, which aligns well with the user's feelings towards the person they regularly deal with. The contextual relevance is moderate; the lyrics reflect interpersonal conflict and emotional turmoil, which is somewhat relevant to dealing with an irritating person. However, the song's aggressive tone and mention of extreme reactions (e.g., 'freak the fuck out') might not perfectly match the user's situation if their irritation is less intense. The lyrical coherence is lower due to the disjointed and somewhat chaotic nature of the lyrics, which might make it harder for the user to find a clear and relatable message."
Someone at work has been handling things incredibly well. I just wanted to say I genuinely respect how he manages everything.,oh lord oh lord you are my god and king you are wise in righteousness standing in power your children will be great hallelujah standing in righteousness you are my strong tower you are lord of all the earth i will praise you ,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song primarily focuses on religious praise and worship, which does not align well with the user's prompt about workplace respect and management. The emotional alignment is low because the song's theme of divine adoration and power does not reflect the secular admiration and respect intended in the prompt. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it does not address workplace dynamics or the act of managing tasks effectively. The lyrics are coherent in the context of a religious or worship song, maintaining a consistent theme of praising a divine figure, which is why it scores higher in lyrical coherence."
"I’ve been taking care of a little bunny for a couple of years, and I feel so responsible for his well-being. He means a lot to me.",ooh baby i ve found the nerve to try again some broken hearts given time will mend will you be gentle if i surrender all to you to you please understand that i ve got to be sure the lessons i ve learned i can t ignore will you be gentle if i surrender all to you to you take good care of me cause my heart s a tender thing oh yeah take good care of me cause this heart has known much pain and could never handle hurting again so take good care of me of me don t get me wrong cause i really care but a shadow of doubt has always been there please reassure me hold me and kiss my fears away my fears away something tells me it s right this time it took a little while but i made up my mind please reassure me that we ll be together come what may come what may take good care of me cause my heart s a tender thing oh yeah take good care of me cause this heart has known much pain and could never handle hurting again so take good care of me of me  i know forever s never promised to anyone so if it can t be forever i ll take what i can get cause baby you re the best thing that ever happened to me yet oh oh oh oh baby so if it can t be forever i ll take what i can get cause baby you re the best thing that ever happened to me yet oh take good care of me cause my heart s a tender thing wow oh no no take good care oh baby cause this heart has known much pain and could never handle hurting again so take you got my heart in your hands this time wow oh baby i give it to you all me baby cause this heart has known much pain and could never handle hurting again,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.3,"The song's lyrics emphasize themes of vulnerability, care, and the fear of being hurt again, which aligns well with the user's emotional state of feeling responsible and caring deeply for their bunny. The emotional alignment score is high because the song captures the essence of caring deeply for someone and the fear of potential loss or hurt. However, the contextual relevance is lower because the song is clearly about a romantic or personal human relationship rather than the care of an animal. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express the emotions and requests for care and reassurance, which is why the coherence score is also high. Overall, the song resonates emotionally but misses the mark on the specific context of caring for a pet."
I just got here and I feel completely disoriented. I don’t understand what’s going on or what I’m supposed to be doing.,all of the feeling that kept me alive no longer lives here now i feel nothing something inside turned the lights out i understand you so i don t know why i can t break through you understand me so i don t know why you stay here everything i knew is up in the air,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of disorientation and emotional numbness, aligning well with the user's feelings of confusion and uncertainty, scoring a 4 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on themes of change and feeling lost, which is relevant to the user's situation, earning a 3. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat lacking due to the disjointed structure and lack of clear narrative, resulting in a score of 2. Overall, the song moderately addresses the user's emotional and contextual needs but could be improved in lyrical clarity."

The emotional alignment score is low because the lyrics seem to focus more on past experiences, confusion, and a sense of lingering doubt, which contrasts with the user's current positive and curious mindset. Contextually, the song also scores low as it does not directly address or inspire the exploration of new knowledge or ideas, instead discussing personal reflections and past interactions. The lyrical coherence of the song is also low, as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and difficult to follow, lacking a clear narrative or theme that connects smoothly. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's described emotional and contextual needs."
"More than anything right now, I just want to grow and improve. I want to become someone I can be proud of.",we can pretend who we can be a dancer in a top hat or a captain of the sea i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song's lyrics reflect a strong desire for self-acceptance and authenticity, aligning well with the user's emotional state of wanting to grow and improve into someone they can be proud of. This earns a score of 4 for emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on self-expression and being true to oneself, which is relevant to the user's goal of personal growth, resulting in a score of 3. The lyrics, while repetitive, are clear and understandable but lack a deeper narrative or complexity, leading to a coherence score of 3. Overall, the song moderately supports the user's emotional and contextual needs with a straightforward message about being oneself."
"I thought I could rely on someone close to me, but they let me down again. It hurts more than I expected.",no i didn t think you would let me down that easy oh no girl and i didn t think it was over until you walked away like it was nothing baby and that moment was so hard for me to breathe yeah cause you took away the biggest part of me yeah life was so unpredictable yeah never thought a love like yours would leave me all alone oh no didn t waste any time but you had already made up your mind no sympathy cause i was out of line oh yeah but i didn t think you would let me down that easy oh no girl and i didn t think it was over until you walked away like it was nothing girl it was a bad day hey girl i knew i was wrong but you could ve said goodbye baby it was a bad day now i m like woah it was a bad day it was a bad day27,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics closely align with the user's emotional state of feeling let down by someone close, as it speaks directly about being unexpectedly abandoned ('you walked away like it was nothing, baby'). This reflects a strong emotional alignment. Contextually, the song fits well with the theme of betrayal and disappointment in a relationship, which parallels the user's experience of trust being broken. The lyrics, while repetitive and somewhat simplistic, maintain a coherent narrative about the impact of this betrayal, though they could benefit from more varied expression and depth to fully capture the complexity of the user's feelings."
"I tried to accept things the way they are, but I can’t anymore. I don’t agree with what’s happening, and I think I need to walk away.",i m breaking out these walls can t hold me any longer days pass me by and i got stronger with every breath i ever took i doubted this world as a whole i refuse to live in a world that refuses me i refuse to live a life that isn t right for me i refuse i m breaking out when reality comes i ll shove it away and try to make it to another day i refuse,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
I was asked to do something today that almost made me puke. I couldn’t even pretend to be okay with it.,vomit in the ball pit step right in and drown in it i saw it when i was a little kid it fucked me up and made me sick so i said auuuuuuugh auuuuuuugh and late at night i still smell it the stench of rancid clown vomit so i went to see a therapist he said face your fear and shit on it so i said auuuuuuugh auuuuuuugh auuuuuuugh auuuuuuugh vomit in the ball pit step right up and take a shit i pinched the loaf that cured my head but now my ass is burning red so i said auuuuuuugh auuuuuuugh auuuuuuugh auuuuuuugh,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.7,"The song's lyrics, while crude and explicit, align closely with the user's feeling of disgust and repulsion, as expressed in the prompt. The repeated expressions of revulsion ('auuuuuuugh') and references to nausea ('vomit', 'made me sick') mirror the user's emotional state effectively. Contextually, the song's theme of dealing with a nauseating situation through extreme and humorous measures somewhat fits the user's experience of being asked to do something repulsive. However, the coherence of the lyrics is low, as the narrative is disjointed and the language is overly vulgar, which might detract from its therapeutic value."

However, the song primarily focuses on a romantic relationship gone wrong, which does not directly relate to the user's experience of social embarrassment. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and disjointed, making them difficult to follow, which affects their coherence. Overall, while there are elements of emotional resonance, the song does not effectively address the specific context of the user's situation."
My new air fryer arrives in only a week! I want to use it right now!,i wanna go to mexico take my fishing rod catch a fish taco i wanna eat a burrito today i wanna go to italy get tangled up in spaghetti share a pizza with myself and me today i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world today i wanna go somewhere in france wine and dine without my pants have a snail trail leading up to my mouth today i wanna go to japan eat all the sushi that i can make my way to sweden even though i ve eaten today i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world today i wanna go to america hang out with the movie stars eat a thousand cheese burgers in my car today i wanna go to africa eat a bowl of ebola go to mozambique to get something to eat today i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world i wanna eat everything in this world today ,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The song's emotional alignment scores a 2 as it captures a sense of eagerness and desire related to food, which loosely connects to the excitement about using a new air fryer. However, the contextual relevance is low, scoring a 1, because the song focuses on traveling and eating around the world rather than the specific context of cooking or using kitchen appliances like an air fryer. The lyrical coherence is also low, scoring a 1, due to the repetitive nature and somewhat nonsensical lines (e.g., 'eat a bowl of ebola'), which detract from a fluent and sensible narrative. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's prompt about the anticipation of using a new air fryer, focusing instead on a broader and less relevant theme of global culinary exploration."
"I had a terrifying moment recently—my whole body froze, and I felt like something horrible was about to happen.",awakened by the fear of an omnipresent danger and the absence of touch accordingly my heart beats alone sucked dry of all emotion it bleeds for feeling but i m so scared i ll run into another wall afraid to lose my mortality i stand alone shivering cold alone naked for the world to see breathing becomes easy as i come closer to confronting my fear now i lay in that same dead end state as i was before frozen from your icy touch cold as i was before alone for the world to see,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"The song lyrics strongly align with the user's emotional state of fear and the sensation of being frozen, scoring high in emotional alignment. The context of feeling exposed and vulnerable matches the user's description of a terrifying moment, making it contextually relevant. However, the lyrical coherence is slightly lower due to some repetitive phrases and a somewhat disjointed narrative flow, which might make it harder for the user to fully connect with the song on a coherent level."
"I’ve been reflecting lately, and I just feel really grateful for everything and everyone that I have in my life.",i woke up this morning growth in my right mind counting all the blessings i ve had in my lifetime i m so fortunate to have someone like god heavenly father when i was having so many problems no one but him could help me solve them he stepped in and he made everything okay and for this i m so grateful i m grateful so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful i m so thankful to be in the land of the living i don t mind sharing my testimony to anyone who hear it cause i m led by the spirit and it s possible that something i might say could help along the way yeah been through the storm but here i m still standing on solid ground i keep on landing that s why i have so much faith in god for his love i m grateful i m grateful so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful i m so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful i m so thankful to be in the land of the living  oh yeah i m grateful yes i m thankful he spared me he gave me another chance i am i m grateful so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful i m so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful i m so thankful to be in the land of the living i m grateful,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The song lyrics strongly align with the user's emotional state of gratitude, as expressed through the repeated affirmations of being 'grateful' and 'thankful' for life and overcoming challenges, which matches the user's feeling of gratefulness for everything in their life. Contextually, the song fits well as it discusses gratitude broadly, though it specifically emphasizes spiritual gratitude and overcoming adversity, which might slightly deviate from the user's general sense of thankfulness. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express the theme of gratitude, though the repetitive nature might slightly impact the lyrical depth and variety."
"Someone very important to me is gone, and no matter how much time passes, I still feel the weight of that loss.",you took all without consideration when you die i ll be the aberration you made me to be before you stole my life but i ll remain with my pain,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.67,"The song lyrics chosen reflect a sense of loss and pain, which aligns to some extent with the user's emotional state of feeling the weight of a significant loss. However, the lyrics focus more on anger and betrayal ('you took all without consideration', 'you die I'll be the aberration'), which might not fully resonate with the user's sentiment of mourning and missing someone important. Contextually, the song addresses the theme of loss but from a perspective of resentment rather than sorrow or remembrance, which might not be entirely relevant to the user's feelings. The lyrical coherence is low, as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear, fluent narrative, making it harder for the user to find solace or connection in them."
I've been smiling for the last three hours. I can't believe this is my life,wake up and i greet the sun feel like this is gonna be my special one my idea of fun to be at the right place at the right time crucify the lies then you realize being alive is something wake up and i greet the sun feel like this is gonna be my special one my idea of fun to be at the right place at the right time celestial surprise before your eyes impossible is nothing,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song captures a positive and uplifting emotion, aligning well with the user's feeling of joy and disbelief about their life circumstances, hence the high emotional alignment score. The lyrics about greeting the sun and feeling like it's going to be a special day resonate with the user's elated mood. However, the contextual relevance is moderate as the song's theme of seizing the day and realizing potential only partially matches the user's specific experience of sustained happiness and surprise about their life. The lyrical coherence is average; while the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and simplistic, they maintain a consistent theme and are understandable, contributing to the overall mood of the song."
There’s someone I can’t stop thinking about lately. I think I’m in love with them.,ohhh yeah ohhh baby ohhh yeah i m in love with a good woman who understands she can t go far in this world if she hasn t got a good man i m in love i m in love love love love make me feel good all over i m in love i know yall know what i m talkin about i ts like this i feel just like a baby boy on christmas day with a brand new toy i m in love yeah i m in love love love bobby play your guitar ohhhh make me feel good do it again do it again and again and again if you got somebody you can call your very own i know y all know what i m talkin about,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a strong emotional alignment with the user's feelings of being in love, scoring a 4. The repeated affirmations of love and the joy it brings closely match the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song scores a 3 as it speaks about being in love, which is relevant, but it specifically mentions a 'good woman' and a 'good man,' which may not universally apply depending on the user's situation. The lyrical coherence scores a 2 due to the somewhat repetitive and disjointed nature of the lyrics, which might make it harder for some listeners to fully engage with the song's message."
I stood in front of a huge and wasn't able to blurt out a single sentence. My knees were shaking the whole time.,i spent my night sweating through my clothes and screaming til my throat ached like burning coals still its not right now that everything i know gets caught between the gnashing teeth of the hype machine and so it goes ive never felt more alone,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.67,"The song captures a sense of intense emotional distress and physical discomfort, which aligns somewhat with the user's experience of nervousness and physical shaking. However, the song's focus on screaming and feeling alone due to external pressures (hype machine) doesn't perfectly match the user's context of being unable to speak in front of a crowd. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, though the stream-of-consciousness style and lack of punctuation can make them challenging to follow. Overall, while there are elements of emotional alignment, the specific context and clarity of the lyrics are not as strong."
I just know that tomorrow is going to be the best day ever,walkin side by side we scale the mountains high oh oh throw fingers up for weather for you i ll collect feathers oh oh may tomorrow be this good the wolves howl through the night and though they re out of sight i move close to your side there s no one but each other wouldn t want no other may tomorrow be this good the blisters on our feet are fading bittersweet and i look up at you i see the future through and i see i see that tomorrow will be so good too tomorrow will be so good be so good be so good be so,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song's lyrics align perfectly with the user's optimistic outlook about tomorrow being a great day, scoring high in emotional alignment. The lyrics not only reflect a sense of anticipation and hope for the future but also a deep connection with a companion, which resonates with the idea of shared joy and experiences, thus scoring high in contextual relevance. The lyrics are mostly coherent and flow well, though some repetitive phrases slightly affect the overall fluency, leading to a slightly lower score in lyrical coherence."
"Today someone told me I don't belong, but I know that I must fight for my ideals and show them to the world!",i know this is wrong you say the word i ll be the war i am the blood i am all that you know i see the devil and i know your name our time has come no matter what you say the voids we fill don t make us beautiful all the hope that we kill will slowly end us take the time to heal til then refuse it so cut it down i want the fight without a choice say the word and all is yours i m the blood i m the chosen give them something to see here,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of defiance and determination, aligning well with the user's emotional state of needing to fight for their ideals despite opposition. This scores a 4 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the lyrics touch on themes of conflict and standing one's ground, which is relevant to the user's situation of being told they don't belong, scoring a 3. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat lacking; the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and cryptic, making it harder to fully grasp a clear narrative or message, resulting in a score of 2. Overall, the song moderately supports the user's emotional and contextual needs but could benefit from clearer lyrical expression."
"After going over the situation again, something finally clicked for me. I understand now what I didn’t see before.",i think i need a new progression a new perspective i think it s finally time i realized i learned my lesson i think i m ready for my life to come and get me now now i m not one to know it all but this i know is true they say that everything you need is right inside of you i think i m ready for my life to come and get me now ohhoo i think i m ready for my life to come and get me,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics align well with the user's emotional state of realization and readiness for change, as reflected in the lines 'i think it's finally time i realized i learned my lesson' and 'i think i'm ready for my life to come and get me now.' These lyrics mirror the user's newfound understanding and preparedness to move forward, scoring high in emotional alignment and contextual relevance. However, the lyrical coherence is slightly lower due to some repetitive phrases and a less structured flow, which might slightly hinder the full expression of the song's message."
After today’s show I was finally able to relax for a while,im so glad i waited for this every nervous moment worth it every anxious wave rode through to find me lying safe with you all too right righteous coward chicken head waiting for a storm in paradise push whine push to gripe to her at me we killed the jealous killed the judgment right im so glad the wait is through im so glad i waited for you,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of relief and satisfaction after enduring a period of tension, which aligns well with the user's emotion of relaxation after a show. This scores high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song seems to discuss overcoming emotional hurdles and finding solace with another person, which somewhat fits the theme of relaxation after an event, though it's more focused on interpersonal dynamics rather than a solitary moment of relaxation. The lyrical coherence is somewhat lower as the lyrics are a bit disjointed and abstract, making it harder to follow a clear narrative or message."
"The more I think about it, the more I realize I made a terrible mistake. I really regret what I did.",i regret leaving my soul i forgot i needed it to feel and maybe when i die i ll just grab it real quick i m coming right back i regret leaving my mind i forgot i needed it to think and maybe to keep me alive i can t believe i got so far with a head so empty but i still have eyes wait for me wait for me but i still have feet wait for me wait for me i regret leaving at all i forgot i needed god like big brother and maybe when i die yeah when i die i won t die escaping i ll die returning to the fold but i still have eyes wait for me wait for me but i still have feet wait for me wait for me but i still have faith if i ever had faith wait for me wait for me,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"The song lyrics strongly align with the user's emotional state of regret and reflection on past mistakes, scoring high in emotional alignment. The context of regret and seeking redemption or return is also well-matched, though the specific references to leaving one's soul and mind might not directly resonate with all aspects of the user's situation, slightly lowering the contextual relevance score. The lyrical coherence is moderate; while the lyrics are impactful and thematic, the repetitive and somewhat disjointed structure might make it harder for some listeners to follow the narrative or message clearly."
I haven’t been able to stop crying. I just feel this overwhelming sadness I don’t know how to handle.,halfway in and i m feeling so left alone look right through and it s hard enough to see it go am i blind to think that it would never end left behind i should ve known that it was over then and it s all gone now it s so sad to say it and you re so down it s so sad to see you lost and found and those feelings are dragging you down feeling so feeling low down and we re nowhere near the end and it s all gone now it s so sad to say it and you re so down it s so sad to see you it s so sad to see you go,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song chosen aligns well emotionally with the user's feelings of overwhelming sadness and the sense of being alone, as reflected in the lyrics about feeling left alone and the sadness of things ending. This earns a score of 4 for emotional alignment. Contextually, the song fits the theme of sadness and loss, which is relevant to the user's emotional state, scoring a 3. However, the lyrical coherence of the song is somewhat lacking. The lyrics are repetitive and somewhat disjointed, which might make it harder for the user to fully connect with the song, leading to a score of 2 in coherence. Overall, the song is a decent match for the user's emotional and contextual needs but could be improved in terms of lyrical clarity and flow."
My family just told me something completely unexpected... I’m still trying to wrap my head around it.,well i was ready to walk into your heart i ll make believe there s something i ve lost but i think you know what i ve done oh i think you know i ll be your surprise it s just a secret that s alwasy on display or just a memory you can t throw away oh i ll be your surprise,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song's emotional alignment scores a 2 as it touches on themes of surprise and hidden secrets, which could loosely relate to the user's feeling of shock from unexpected family news. However, it doesn't deeply resonate with the emotional complexity or the specific nature of processing unexpected information. The contextual relevance is low, scoring a 1, because the lyrics primarily focus on a personal relationship and secrets within it, rather than a family dynamic or the broader context of receiving unexpected news. The lyrical coherence is moderate, scoring a 2, as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making it difficult to derive a clear and fluent narrative or message."
