Watching my teammate stay late to coach the interns after hours left me genuinely inspired.,they had been listening to our music and was inspired by what we did and just the fact that ya know big pun was covering it and getting at me to be in the video it made me feel good like a legend before my times they did that like nobody else could do that cause that was one of those classic records that was like if you touch it you gotta really know what you doing or you really mess up the ingredients and they touched it and really put they own ingredients on it to make it sound real smooth,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The recommended song lyrics do not align well with the user's emotional prompt of feeling inspired by a selfless act of coaching. The lyrics discuss a personal feeling of validation and pride in one's work being recognized and remixed by others, which is a different kind of inspiration focused more on personal achievement and legacy rather than altruistic mentorship. The context of the song, dealing with music industry achievements, does not match the user's context of a workplace or team environment. Additionally, the lyrical coherence is low, as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and difficult to follow, lacking a clear narrative or fluency."

The lyrics delve into darker, more violent themes with references to warfare, violence, and disaster, which starkly contrasts the playful and innocent context of the user's prompt. The coherence of the lyrics is also low, as the narrative jumps abruptly between various intense scenarios without a clear connection or storyline. Overall, the song does not match the emotional or contextual needs of the user's prompt, and the lyrics are challenging to follow."
The courier dumped my brand-new keyboard in a puddle and walked off—I'm fuming.,youre the one that made me have to walk away you tried to compromise and make me change my ways you left me cold and ive got nothing more to say you left me dry and ive got nothing more to say1,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of frustration and abandonment, which aligns somewhat with the user's emotion of anger due to the mishandling of their delivery. However, the song seems to focus more on a personal or emotional betrayal rather than an incident of negligence, which limits its contextual relevance to the specific situation described by the user. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and simplistic but maintain a basic coherence in expressing the theme of being left alone and disappointed."
The elevator keeps dinging on every floor even when nobody’s inside; it’s testing my patience.,waiting to put my feet on the ground i m tired of going up and down but sometimes it feels safer waiting it s beautiful at the top but i never really get a chance to stop it feels like i am falling again doors are opening doors are closing people come and go but i m still riding elevators never here or there on the ground or in the air people come and go but i m still riding elevators everyone seems to have somewhere to go i dream of going with them but i don t i m looking down always on every floor but i never really find what i m looking for but i keep looking for you doors are opening doors are closing people come and go but i m still riding elevators never here or there on the ground or in the air people come and go but i m still riding elevators if i get off and i could get lost or better if you were there i wouldn t have to keep riding elevators doors are opening doors are closing people come and go but i m still riding elevators never here or there on the ground or in the air people come and go but i m still riding elevators never here or there on the ground or in the air people come and go but i m still riding elevators,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
My colleague refactored the legacy code and now it runs twice as fast—exactly what we needed.,we have the technology we have the technology1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.67,"The song lyrics provided are minimal and repetitive, making it difficult to fully align with the emotional and contextual nuances of the user's prompt. The mention of 'technology' loosely connects to the theme of coding and improvements in efficiency, but the lack of depth and detail in the lyrics fails to capture the specific achievement or the positive impact described in the prompt. Additionally, the lyrics lack fluency and coherence, consisting only of a repeated phrase, which does not form a meaningful narrative or emotional expression."
"Let me know the moment you get home so I can relax, please.",do you want me to go i ll drive home it s alright hold the thought so tightly it was just a passing thing come inside have a seat i ll be with you soon you don t seem to have feeling turn the lights off when you leave,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song's emotional alignment scores a 2 as it somewhat captures the sense of waiting and concern, though it lacks a direct reflection of relaxation or reassurance once the person arrives home. Contextually, the song scores a 1 because it only vaguely relates to the theme of someone coming home and the associated interactions, but it does not clearly address the user's need to know when the other person has arrived so they can relax. The lyrical coherence is rated at 2, as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative flow, making it difficult to fully grasp the intended message or emotion."

The lyrics are disjointed and primarily focus on personal and intimate relationships, which is unrelated to the user's issue with a website interface. The coherence of the lyrics is also low, as they are repetitive and lack a clear narrative or message that could be relevant to the user's situation."
I can’t stop wondering what the northern lights look like in person.,if i could take a look through picture frames and books i wonder what it is i d see cities lights and sunsets faces i dont know yet think of what the time can bring run like rivers chasing dreams i kiss you in the city streets see young hwart with a brand new point of view when we grow old well turn the pages take a look back down through the ages it was bright all this life i lived with you if i could take a look through picture frames and books i wonder what it is i d see,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song's lyrics touch on the theme of looking back through memories, which loosely connects to the user's curiosity about experiencing the northern lights. However, the emotional alignment is weak as the song does not specifically evoke the awe or wonder typically associated with seeing the northern lights. Contextually, the song fails to directly address or evoke the imagery of the northern lights or similar experiences, focusing instead on general retrospection through life's moments. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack clarity, which affects their coherence. Overall, the song does not strongly match the user's emotional and contextual prompt."
It's only Tuesday and I'm already day-dreaming about sinking into a hammock by the sea in my weekend.,so here i go i ll dive right in break through the waves straight to the ocean floor and although my hands are shaking i lie perfectly still cause i m determined to let myself sink down and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again i could wave my arms and swim away but never reach the shore but for now i will lay face first in the sand with the wreckage from ships that lost their way and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again and although my hands are shaking i lie perfectly still cause i m determined to let myself sink down and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
Spent a week on that proposal and it didn’t even make the meeting agenda—ouch.,not submitted,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Without the recommended song lyrics, it's impossible to evaluate how well the song matches the user's emotional and contextual prompt.

My teammate keeps blaring voice notes on speaker in the open office; I swear earbuds were invented for a reason.,maybe there are cartwheels in your mouth maybe your words will grow up to be a gymnasts maybe you have been kicking people with them by accident i know some people get a whole lot of rocking in the rocking chair and the ones who dont sometimes get rocks in their voice boxes and their voice boxes become slingshots maybe you think my heart looks like a baby squirrel but you absolutely missed when you told the class i have head lice cause i one hundred percent absolutely do not have head lice and even if i do it is a fact that head lice prefer clean heads over dirty ones so i am clean as a whistle on a tea pot my mother says it is totally fine if i blow off steam as long as i speak in an octave my kindness can still reach my kindness knows mermaids never ever miss their legs in the water cause there are better ways to move through the ocean than kicking so guess what if i ever have my own team i am picking everyone first even the worst kid and the kid with the stutter like a skipping record cause i know all of us are scratched even if you cant hear it when we speak my mother says most people have heartbeats that are knocking on doors that will never open and i know my heart is a broken freezer chest cause i can never keep anything frozen so no i am not always crying i am just thawing outside of the lines and even if i am always crying it is a fact that salt is the only reason everything floats so good in the dead sea and just cause no one ever passes notes to me doesnt mean i am not super duper in fact my super duper might be a buoy or a paper boat the next time your nose gets stuck up the river cause it is a fact that our hearts stop every for a milli second every time we sneeze and some peoples houses have too much dust some peoples fathers are like attics ive heard attics have monsters in their walls and shaky stares i think if i lived in a house with attic id nightmare a burglar in my safety chest and maybe id look for rest in the sticks and stones cause my mother says a person can only swallow so much punch before hes drunk on his own fist but the only drunk i ever knew was sleeping in the alley behind our church and jesus turned water into his wine so even god has his bad days but on your bad days couldnt you just say hey im having a bad day instead of telling me im stupid or poor or telling me i dress like a boy cause maybe i am a boy and a girl maybe my name is andrea andrew so what it is a fact that bumblebees have hair on their eyes and humans also should comb though everything they see like an anchorman is not a sailor like the clouds might be a pillow fight like my mother says every bird perched on a telephone wire will listen to the conversations running through its feet to decide the direction of its flight so i know every word we speak can make hurricanes in peoples weather veins or shine their shiny shine so maybe sometime you could sit beside me on the bus and i could say guess what it is a fact that manatees have vocal chords but do not have ears and beethoven made music even when he could no longer hear and i know every belt that has hit someones back is still a belt that was built to hold something up and it is fact that egyptians slept on pillows made of stone but its not hard for me to dream that maybe one day youll write me back like the day i wrote the lightening bug to say i smashed my mason jar and i threw away the lid i didnt want to take a chance that id grow up to be a war i want to be a belly dance or an accordion or a pogo stick or the fingerprints the mason left in the mortar between the bricks to prove that he was here that he built a roof over someones head to keep the storm from their faith my mother says thats why we all were born and i think shes right so write back soon sincerely yours 1,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of frustration and annoyance caused by a teammate's behavior in an office setting. The song's lyrics are abstract and poetic, discussing themes of personal expression, resilience, and understanding, which do not directly relate to the user's context of workplace etiquette and the specific issue with noise. The lyrics are somewhat coherent within their own style, presenting a stream-of-consciousness that touches on various metaphors and personal reflections, but they do not provide a clear or relevant message that would resonate with or address the user's current situation."
Opened the fridge and the sour-milk smell nearly knocked me over.,i woke up covered in sand it s not so ugly now i ve seen its face oh i can hear it breathing it bites my thumb i throw it at the wall i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm it didn t take too long only bout an hour in the coals we all sat down to eat it the meal was burnt i cut my gums on bone i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm and as blue as my back  i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm and the moon was the size of my hand,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.3,"The song lyrics have a surreal and somewhat disturbing imagery that partially aligns with the discomfort suggested by the user's experience with sour milk, hence a score of 2 for emotional alignment. However, the song's context of surreal experiences and physical reactions diverges significantly from the simple domestic scenario of encountering sour milk in a fridge, leading to a score of 1 for contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are disjointed and lack a clear narrative or logical progression, making them difficult to follow, which results in a coherence score of 1. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's prompt in terms of emotion, context, or lyrical clarity."
"I started presenting, then realized the slide on screen was upside down—facepalm moment.",i tell you there are no big shots in reality y all we re all in the same boat dealing with the same issues same problems same stuff don t even buy it all the perpetration you know all this we don t have problems that s a lie that s a lie i know that the enemy is doing the same thing to me that he s doing to everybody else i just know now that the only way to get out is through confrontation see we always thought it was retreat you know run away and i m telling you you got to confront it this is a strange song because this song when this song was written this is when everything sort of stopped it was written a long time ago but it was right before god just snatched me out of everything and because i didn t understand initially it was written i d written it about the whole amadou diallo situation when it first happened and i went to the studio and i laid it down and it was like strong for the first day and then it just regressed everyday after that and i said what s going on what s happening and at the end of it there was a word that i used rebel and i guess was afraid it was such a hot time in the city at that point i was afraid that if i put the record out people would misunderstand what i meant by rebel and they d just take it to the streets so i was very intimidated and afraid and before i knew it a whole host of things happened everything stopped after that and the creativity stopped everything stopped that s when i realized i had to understand what i was talking about before i could tell somebody else what i was talking about and i had to be you know a living example it s real crazy because i don t know what the press is saying because i don t listen to the press too much but i know the view is that i m emotionally unstable which is reality like you aren t i m laughing because what i ve realized i ve become is one of those mad scientists who does the tests on themselves first you see to make sure that they work and that s when you know ok look i got something that works you know what i m saying i m not gonna give you something that i haven t tested for myself and you go through and you re learning by way of experience and you re making mistakes and you re getting up a friend of mine once said to me he said look if we weren t supposed to turn around why does a car have a steering wheel are we just supposed to crash into the wall no we re supposed to say listen i was going the wrong way reverse in this particular song now i realize that this song is about freedom you see we could look at one human being but it s about the spirit of freedom being taken out and how it s taken out in all of us the song is called i find it hard to say bear with me a little bit,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's prompt, which describes a humorous and slightly embarrassing situation of presenting with an upside-down slide. The song lyrics delve into deep and serious themes such as personal confrontation, societal issues, and self-experimentation, which do not reflect the light-hearted embarrassment of the user's experience. The context of the song, dealing with profound realizations and societal commentary, is irrelevant to the simple and relatable office mishap described. Additionally, the lyrical coherence is low as the lyrics are somewhat rambling and disjointed, making it difficult to follow a clear narrative or theme."

The lyrics suggest themes of deceit, struggle, and resignation, which contrast sharply with the user's upbeat mood. Contextually, the song is irrelevant to the scenario of attending a sports event, as it deals with personal and possibly internal conflicts rather than a public, celebratory setting. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, with a consistent theme of hiding and deception, but they are complex and could be confusing without more context about the song's narrative."
Someone knocked on the door at midnight and then went silent; my heart’s racing.,i ve been waiting for some time cause tonight she is mine yeah i called her on the phone what she said turned me on she said no boys til midnight so i walked to her house just to see what she s about when i knocked on her door i heard her say once more she said no boys till midnight she said no boys til midnight no boys til midnight no boys til midnight she said no boys til midnight she said no boys til midnight she said no boys no boys no boys,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.5,"The emotional alignment of the recommended song with the user's prompt is low. The prompt suggests a scenario filled with suspense and anxiety, whereas the song's lyrics convey a more playful and anticipatory mood related to waiting for a romantic encounter. The contextual relevance is slightly better as the song does involve the act of knocking on a door and waiting until midnight, which loosely connects to the user's scenario of a midnight occurrence. However, the reasons and emotions behind the actions are quite different. The lyrical coherence of the song is moderate; the lyrics are repetitive and focus on a single theme, which makes them somewhat easy to follow but lacks depth and variety in storytelling."
Got home drenched from the rain and found a thermos of hot tea waiting on my desk—little gestures like that rescue a day.,jai bu un th i drank some tea taqqalahi tisnant alshash ere s taqqal sallul asraf eswegh atay ihan elkas azzar s ulhin har tisantas tennedahi ham wer djennegh fel nammoqqas hamti d sektugh ere s taqqal sallul asraf ed es nedjet nammos aslaf tamat tidagh dagh dassidjegh wer asbakegh wer aqqimagh akfor ahar abrur edjar muchan arne berin labkhar,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.67,"The song lyrics provided are mostly in a language that is not immediately recognizable or translatable without specific cultural or linguistic knowledge, which significantly impacts the coherence score as the lyrics do not make sense to a general audience. The mention of 'tea' in the lyrics does weakly align with the user's experience of finding hot tea, which slightly raises the emotional and contextual scores. However, the overall connection to the user's feelings of warmth and comfort from a thoughtful gesture is not clearly conveyed in the song, resulting in low scores for emotional alignment and contextual relevance."
"Every corner of the house still echoes dad’s jokes, and he’s not here anymore.",the only thing that was in the way was not clear please show and everything they said we couldnt be i shed my fear you know go home go home back to where you used to be missed jokes shadows fill the air in between the city is so bright you can see things have changed so mad and everyone you know can only be prearranged so sad go home go home back to where you used to be missed jokes shadows fill the air in between today in this world my voice is gone washed away returning home doesnt feel all the same when memories are all we have when all we have is in our heads,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's emotional tone aligns well with the user's prompt, reflecting a sense of loss and nostalgia, particularly with lines like 'missed jokes shadows fill the air' and 'returning home doesn't feel all the same when memories are all we have.' This captures the essence of missing a loved one and the emptiness felt in familiar spaces. Contextually, the song addresses returning to a place filled with memories, which resonates with the user's mention of their father's presence in every corner of the house. However, the song's lyrical coherence is somewhat lacking; the lyrics are disjointed and can be confusing, reducing the overall clarity and impact of the message. This affects the song's ability to fully connect with the user's emotional and contextual needs."

The lyrics describe preparing for a glamorous event, which metaphorically resonates with the user's excitement about a significant achievement. However, the song's context of preparing for a formal event is only somewhat relevant to the specific context of receiving a scholarship. The lyrics are coherent and paint a vivid picture of getting ready for a high-class event, though they focus more on physical appearance than the emotional depth of the user's experience."
"She slipped a note into my lunchbox that read “you’ve got this,” and my chest warmed.",she gettin it,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
Waiting outside the exam hall; my notes suddenly look like hieroglyphs.,like notches carved in bones like pictographic stones in fragments and on cliffs i read your hieroglyphs black tablet and gold seal my future you reveal inscriptions left in tunes in alleys and in ruins like notches carved in bones like pictographic stones in fragments and on cliffs i read your hieroglyphs memoranda memoranda memoranda memoranda,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics resonate moderately well with the emotional state of the user, capturing a sense of confusion and mystery akin to deciphering hieroglyphs, which aligns with the user's feeling of their notes being indecipherable. Contextually, the song is quite relevant as it directly references 'hieroglyphs,' mirroring the user's description of their notes. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low; the repetition and abstract references might make it difficult for the user to find a clear, relatable message or comfort in the lyrics, especially in a stressful situation like waiting for an exam."
The sky finally cleared after days of rain—feels like good things are coming.,i can see clearly now the rain has gone i can see all obstacles in my way gone are the dark clouds that had me blind it s going to be a bright bright sunshiny day it s going to be a bright bright sunshiny day i think i can make it now the pain has gone and all of the bad feelings have disappeared here is the rainbow i ve been praying for it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day look all around there s nothing but blue skies look straight ahead nothing but blue skies i think i can make it now the pain has gone and all of the bad feelings have disappeared i can see clearly now the rain has gone it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song 'I Can See Clearly Now' by Johnny Nash aligns perfectly with the user's emotional state of optimism and relief following a period of rain, as it talks about overcoming darkness and seeing bright, sunny days ahead. The lyrics are directly relevant to the context of the weather clearing up and a hopeful outlook, matching the theme of good things coming. The lyrics are generally coherent and fluently express the joy and clarity that come after overcoming challenges, though some repetition might slightly impact the lyrical depth. Overall, the song is an excellent match for the user's prompt, capturing both the emotional essence and the specific context of the situation."
Saw my app featured on the store’s front page—cheeks hurt from smiling.,i stopped off at the grocery store to pick up a few things and i was reaching for some cheerios when i heard someone say my name i knew exactly who it was my heart started to race i turned around my legs got weak when i saw her face there stood the girl that broke my heart just a year ago i thought that i was over her but little did i know that running into her like that would leave me in a total mess wishing that we never said goodbye and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she ran over and hugged my neck i didn t want her to let go she smiled and said i looked just like a kid with my box of cheerios we laughed and talked about old times which wasn t all that smart cause it just left me with an emptiness when she pushed away her cart and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she walked away looked back and smiled clean up on aisle five,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of joy and pride from seeing their app featured. The song's narrative focuses on a melancholic encounter with a past love in a grocery store, which contrasts sharply with the user's celebratory mood. Contextually, the song also misses the mark as it revolves around a personal and sorrowful interaction rather than a professional achievement or celebratory event. The lyrics themselves are coherent and tell a clear story, hence a moderate score in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song is not a good match for the user's described situation and emotions."
Spent half an hour cursing the remote control until I realised I was pointing it at the wrong TV box—light-bulb moment.,i know i can never make up my mind half the time im sick just tryna find a straight light and i thought i saw the light behind your glassy narrow eyes fall fell and the weight came crashing down half the year i spent trying to relieve myself and i thought your hands were warmth something to fix my freezing form but i soon realized again it was just poor circulation and i thought i saw the light behind your glassy narrow eyes but i soon found it to be brewin slowly inside of me,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of realization and self-discovery, which aligns somewhat with the user's 'light-bulb moment' of realization about the remote control. However, the emotional tone of the song, which seems to deal with deeper personal struggles and introspection, doesn't quite match the lighter, somewhat humorous frustration expressed in the user's prompt. Contextually, the song doesn't relate to the specific scenario of dealing with technology or a simple misunderstanding as described by the user. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but can be perceived as disjointed and abstract, making it difficult to grasp a clear narrative or message. Overall, while there are elements of realization in both the song and the prompt, the emotional depth and context differ significantly."
The vet said the tests are normal—I can finally breathe again.,my toes can talk and they re smiling at me come down they say not afraid anymore and they talk to me and they smile at me i walked upstream and i sat in the mud life starts again watching trees decompose and they talk to me and they smile at me 1,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of relief and rejuvenation, which aligns well with the user's emotion of relief after receiving good news from the vet. This is evident in phrases like 'not afraid anymore' and 'life starts again,' which echo the user's newfound peace of mind. However, the context of the song, which seems to involve a more nature-focused and introspective scenario, only partially matches the user's situation concerning pet health. The lyrics, while expressive, are somewhat disjointed and abstract, lacking clear narrative or fluency, which might make it harder for the user to fully connect with the song on a lyrical level."
"I laughed at his idea during the meeting, and guilt’s eating at me now.",i m sorry that joke flew right over your head that time it s not my fault it wasn t mine it s not my fault i couldn t tell if you were gonna laugh or cry at least when you were here i had someone to blame i had someone now it s not that easy and it s not the same well i m filing all the changes down i can turn the pages now i think i m doing okay by myself it just seems a little lonely now just a little while longer now to make myself understand how at least when you were here i had someone to blame i had someone now it s not that easy and it s not the same,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.67,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of regret and longing for the past, which aligns with the user's feelings of guilt. However, the song focuses more on missing someone and the difficulty of change, rather than directly addressing the feeling of guilt over a specific action like laughing at someone's idea. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, but the repetitive structure and lack of clear progression may make it difficult for the user to find direct relevance to their situation. The overall match is moderate as the song captures the general mood of regret but does not specifically address the context of a meeting or the act of laughing at someone's idea."
The empty seat at our usual café table made the coffee taste bitter today.,a city full of people and my favorite is that waitress and she treats me like some type of common vagrant i see her every day but there s nothing to say unless i decide to step inside of that cafe i only get to sit if i buy something to eat otherwise it s best to keep my feet moving down that street and god damn she s a hard bitch talks at me like i m the bad dog that got into the garbage yeah i know that the toilet is for customers you ain t got to tangle up the strings to make this puppet work it doesn t have to be a game of patty cake but it ain t like you don t know i sleep in that alleyway and by the way i can see it in your eyes you re angry with your life not a stranger to the fight i bet you hate every man that you date and you re probably addicted to all types of escape you take it out on me that you re all alone when you know you got your own closet full of hollow bones watch the tone when you speak to old folks i m grown just trying to get out of this minnesota cold look lady i m homeless i m crazy i m so hopeless i m suicidal daily if you and i can t co exist let s fake it cause i ain t got the energy it takes for this relationship i m waiting for a city bus to flatten me and transport me to the ever after happily maybe reincarnated with luck come back to earth as a cockroach in your tip cup she said she s had it up to here she s gonna call authorities if i don t disappear i love her threats it rejuvenates my breath i give her stress for the reaction that it gets i got a pocket full of panhandled money on a cup of bad coffee and a stale honey bun in front of everyone she calls me bum but she notices my absence on them afternoons i don t come so here i am thorn in her hip holding down the corner table all morning with some corn chips ignoring the insults and evil eyes i feed off of em i wonder when she ll realize that she s the only reason i visit the only woman in my world that acknowledges my existence and if my ship ever comes i ll miss it because i m getting old and i ain t got much left to give it so there it is and i have to live with it i had the chance to make a difference but i didn t in the cafe bathroom drinking free tap water thinking damn i should ve been a better father to my daughter 7,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The recommended song lyrics depict a complex relationship between the narrator and a waitress, involving themes of homelessness, neglect, and personal struggles. Emotional alignment scores a 2 as the song does convey a sense of loneliness and bitterness, somewhat aligning with the user's emotion of feeling the bitterness due to an empty seat. However, the song's primary focus on the narrator's personal hardships and confrontational interactions with the waitress diverges significantly from the user's subtle and reflective sadness. Contextually, the song scores a 1 because, although it takes place in a café, the context of the song is more about the narrator's personal struggles rather than a shared, sentimental memory at a café, which was the essence of the user's prompt. Lyrical coherence scores a 3 as the lyrics are clear and tell a coherent story, though the narrative is dense and complex, potentially making it harder to follow without multiple readings."
Walked into the living room and everyone yelled “welcome back!”—did not see that coming.,i didn t know you were there until you said hello you had been watching me for i don t know how long i hit my head against the lamp as by surprise i stood up don t be afraid you said it s only me the door wasn t locked the voice i d heard in the hall was hard to recognize but now we know he s on board wearing our disguise if only you and i could trust each other through this then together we could work out who the enemy is,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's lyrics partially capture the surprise element of the user's prompt with lines like 'I didn't know you were there until you said hello' and 'I hit my head against the lamp as by surprise I stood up.' However, the song then shifts to themes of mistrust and deception, which do not align with the presumably joyful and welcoming scenario described in the prompt. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, though they transition into a narrative that is unrelated to the initial surprise and welcome, thus reducing their contextual relevance. Overall, the song captures the surprise but fails to align with the positive emotional and contextual aspects of the scenario."

My cat tried to pounce on its own shadow and face-planted into the rug; still chuckling.,once i laughed when i heard your saying that i d be playing solitaire uneasy in my easy chair it never entered my mind once you told me i was mistaken that i d awaken with the sun and ordered orange juice for one it never entered my mind you have what i laughed myself now i even have to scratch my back myself once you warned me that if you scorned me i d singing the maiden s prayer again and wish that you were there again to get into my hair again it never entered my mind it never entered my mind,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not align well with the user's prompt. The emotional alignment scores low because the song's themes of loneliness and heartbreak contrast sharply with the lighthearted and humorous tone of the user's experience with their cat. Contextually, the song is also irrelevant as it does not relate to pets, playful mishaps, or anything similar to the user's story about a cat. The lyrics themselves, while somewhat poetic, are disjointed and difficult to follow, leading to a low coherence score. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional or contextual needs."
The airline lost my bag for the third time this year and acted like it wasn't a big deal.,so many took me for granted double crossed me for the bag when it landed i m thinkin you not the only fucking plug on this planet i m patient unfamiliar aircraft in sight,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.5,"The song's emotional alignment with the user's frustration is somewhat present, as it mentions betrayal and disappointment, which could mirror the user's feelings about the airline's negligence. However, the primary emotion in the song seems to be centered around betrayal in a different context, not specifically related to service or customer experience, making it only partially aligned. Contextually, the mention of an 'aircraft' and 'bag' superficially connects to the theme of airline issues, but the overall context of the song seems to be about personal relationships and trust, not customer service or travel logistics. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics make sense within themselves but might be slightly disjointed or cryptic, making it harder to fully grasp or relate to the user's specific situation."

The repeated references to the dripping tap and its implications align well with the user's focus on this specific and persistent sound. Emotionally, the song captures a sense of frustration and helplessness which resonates with the user's inability to focus due to the dripping tap, though it might delve into broader themes that slightly divert from the personal annoyance expressed in the prompt. The lyrical coherence is lower as the song's structure is somewhat repetitive and chaotic, which might reflect the mental state caused by the constant dripping but makes it harder to follow a clear narrative or message."
My roommate finally started rinsing the dishes instead of piling them up—honestly proud of that progress.,yo listen i met this girl on baltic ave you can tell how she steps on boardwalk she was from park place i asked what she was doing on this side of town she said she had some taxes to pay i figured i d take a chance and advance to go and find out more about her cause there s more to know than the ways she sways and the way that she wears her clothes or the way that she plays this game so cold she said she came up rough and the one income household was not enough there d be nights she d go to sleep cold and hungry cause her mom was always short on food and money see people used to joke a lot and tease her bout her clothes not being in style dressed in dingy skirts and dirty sneakers from the finest second hand down on oriental ave but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she s got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly once she graduated jr high she started working overtime scrubbing floors or working on assembly lines just so she could help her mother out and after college they moved into marvin s garden and she got a job working at the city water department to save enough cash to move into community chest condos on pennsylvania ave she fell in love with this dude name ray who was a small time hustler from st charles place and he was known for always being in and out of trouble but the problem was that he was never on her level she argued with her mom about ray s work till he got sent upstate on the same say that she gave birth but see the baby never made it it drove her nearly crazy and she couldn t take it  but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she s got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly listen see where she came from many people find it hard just to hang on you often find them in the same place complaining instead of finding a better way of maintaining she could have balled up and cried and wished that she would die and just gave up on trying instead she grind from the bottom just to make it to the bottom now she s on top and she s flying but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly womanopoly yeah she s got it whoa yeah alright ,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song 'Womanopoly' tells a story of struggle, perseverance, and eventual success, which aligns with the theme of overcoming challenges and making progress. However, the emotional tone of the song, which deals with serious life struggles and societal issues, does not closely match the light and somewhat humorous tone of the user's prompt about a roommate improving household habits. The context of the song, focusing on life's hardships and personal growth in a socio-economic framework, is quite distant from the domestic and casual context of the user's situation. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear narrative, although the complex story might detract from the simplicity of the user's prompt. Overall, while the song touches on themes of progress and pride, its heavy and complex narrative does not effectively mirror the lightness and simplicity of the user's emotional and contextual needs."
Spent half the night checking on my pup’s fever; I’m dead tired but can’t leave his side.,you know i m tired i got a fevered brow you know i d change if i were with her now you gave me drugs you said d cure my ills they may cure yours but mine are with me still if i were with her now if i were with her now if i were with her now,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song's mention of 'tired' and 'fevered brow' aligns somewhat with the user's emotional state of exhaustion and concern for their feverish pup. However, the song's context diverges as it seems to focus more on a human relationship and emotional distress related to another person, rather than the care and worry for a pet. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative flow, which affects their coherence and overall relevance to the user's specific situation of caring for a sick pet."
The app keeps saying ‘unknown error’ and I have no clue what’s actually wrong; my brain’s spinning.,there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake i waited in the rain for hours and you were late now it s not like me to say the right thing but you could ve called to let me know i checked your number twice don t understand it so i went home well i d been waiting for this weekend i thought that maybe we could see a show never dreamed i d have this feeling oh but seeing you is believing that s why i don t know why you didn t show up that night oh there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake i was waiting in the rain for hours and you were late since then i ve been running around trying to find you i went to the places that we always go i rang your home but got no answer so i jumped in my car i went round again i still don t believe it he was just leaving oh there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake yeah oh there must be oh there must be oh oh misunderstanding oh there must be there must be oh oh misunderstanding oh there must be there must be oh oh misunderstanding oh there must be there must be oh oh misunderstanding,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song 'Misunderstanding' by Genesis captures the frustration and confusion of the user's situation well, reflecting the emotional turmoil of not understanding what's wrong, similar to the user's experience with the app error. The theme of waiting and not receiving an expected response aligns somewhat with the user's context of dealing with an unresponsive system. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story of confusion and disappointment, though they are more focused on a personal relationship rather than a technical issue, which slightly reduces the contextual relevance."
Saw a clip of glowing plankton beaches and now I’m itching to know everything about them.,i want to be on an island off the coast of mexico there s an island with tropical sand and boats and humans who light the nighttime sky with fire i wanna colour the sky take a dream with an ember that s dancing itself away from our circle on the beach while we watch bioluminescence make shapes inside the liquid living ocean i wanna swim inside the gulf of mexico1,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,"The song captures the user's fascination with glowing plankton beaches effectively, aligning well with the emotional tone of wonder and curiosity. The context of the song, which describes an island with bioluminescence and a vibrant, natural setting, matches perfectly with the user's interest in glowing plankton beaches. The lyrics, while evocative and rich in imagery, are slightly less coherent due to some grammatical inconsistencies and a somewhat disjointed narrative flow. However, the overall thematic and emotional connection to the user's prompt is strong."
All morning I’ve been day-dreaming about escaping to a quiet cabin in the woods—can almost smell the pine.,in the hour before the devil finds i ve died i ll move slow as my ending descends from the pines because i couldn t stop for death she kindly stopped for me and she stole my breath if i m bound or gagged if i m lost or loosin i might want to leave from here until then i ll still be cruisin high above the atmosphere well i walked through that hour in a drawn out sleepless bliss blinking possibilites shuttered and ceased to exist like a prisoner of my personality my time had come and my body was set free i went easy from my body but harder from my ways i lived tall in this life but i was naked at the end of my born days when desperation rang long through me horses whispered in the distance and my body was set free,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.3,"The song lyrics chosen have a somber and introspective tone, which partially aligns with the user's emotional state of day-dreaming and desire for escape, scoring a 2 for emotional alignment. The mention of 'pines' and a sense of leaving or escaping in the lyrics does fit the theme of retreating to a cabin in the woods, earning a 3 for contextual relevance. However, the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and cryptic, discussing themes of death and existential reflection, which may not fully resonate with the user's lighter, more peaceful day-dreaming about nature. This results in a coherence score of 2. The overall effectiveness of the song in matching the user's prompt is moderate, reflected in the overall score of 2.3."
"Practised for weeks, but the open-mic night was cancelled at the last minute—total letdown.",one night only is not enough,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's lyrics 'one night only is not enough' somewhat align with the emotion of disappointment by suggesting a desire for more, which could reflect the user's feeling of letdown due to the cancellation. However, the lyrics do not specifically address the context of preparation and anticipation for an event, which is central to the user's experience. The lyrics are coherent but very limited in scope and detail, providing minimal narrative or depth to strongly connect with the user's situation."
Can’t stand how people leave popcorn and cups all over the cinema floor after a movie; it really bothers me.,it took you long not to see it took me on not too see you next to me cause you re too hard to read just took a hit of ecstasy the room is spinning all around me but you re still next to to me so why else could you want to leave you said you needed to get going so you came home with me we made a bit of light love we figured we d figure it out in the morning so we ate breakfast early walking out the door is so dishonourable and sleeping on the floor is so fucking uncomfortable and a few months passed by we ran into each other at the movies and avoided eye contact you got some popcorn i got myself a berry smoothie and we entered separately but then when i sat down you were sitting right beside me and i couldn t concentrate so i said a little hey love and you continued to ignore me so i just watched the movie piranha in 3d disappointed me you re sleeping on my arm i ll cut off my numb arm but i don t have a knife so i ll gnaw off my numb arm you re sleeping on my arm i ll saw off my numb arm how did we get here these are my drunk eyes,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The song's emotional alignment scores a 2 as it touches on feelings of frustration and discomfort, which somewhat aligns with the user's annoyance about the mess left in cinemas. However, the context of the song, which revolves around a complex personal relationship and an awkward encounter at the movies, only marginally relates to the user's prompt about cinema cleanliness, scoring a 1 for contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and hard to follow, leading to a coherence score of 1. The overall effectiveness of this song in addressing the user's specific concerns about cinema etiquette is low, as the primary focus of the song is on personal relationships rather than the behavior of moviegoers."
Stepped into the elevator and the stench of stale sweat hit me so hard it made my stomach flip.,every day i wake up feeling this way i take it downtown with all the action going down i strike a match strike a match cook it up i m feeling so sick i feel so fucking sick on the bathroom floor gotta get out and get right hustling little girls cheating little boys yeah gotta get out gotta get out and get right gotta get out i gotta get out no more no more no more my eternal fire i m feeling so sick on the bathroom floor i m feeling so sick no more yeah i m feeling so sick i feel so sick no no more ,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics chosen do not align well with the user's prompt about the unpleasant experience of a stench in an elevator. The emotional alignment scores low as the song's focus on feeling sick and the repeated mention of being on the bathroom floor only tangentially connects to the user's feeling of nausea caused by a smell. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it discusses broader themes of distress and possibly substance abuse, which do not relate to the simple context of encountering a bad smell in an elevator. The lyrics themselves, while somewhat repetitive and focused on a theme of sickness, maintain a basic level of coherence, though they are disjointed and lack a clear narrative flow."
I called the new boss ‘mom’ during the video call and wanted to crawl under my desk.,mama asked me where i went and i said i went away she asked me why i left and i told her i can t stay there s debts i gotta pay i might come back some day hopped in the back of the 95 chevy and drove it to the coast mom asked me if i got a job and i told her that i sell asked if she needed a few bucks at home and she told me go to hell and i think i might as well till then i ll surf the swell hopped in the back of the 95 chevy and drove it to the coast,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song lyrics chosen do not align well with the user's emotional state or context. The user's prompt describes a moment of embarrassment and awkwardness, whereas the song lyrics discuss leaving home, dealing with personal issues, and a strained relationship with a mother. The emotional tone of the song is more about defiance and escape rather than embarrassment or discomfort. Contextually, the only connection is the mention of 'mom,' but it does not relate to the specific situation of mistakenly calling a boss 'mom.' The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, maintaining a narrative about leaving and facing personal challenges, but they do not directly address or resonate with the user's situation."

The song's focus on personal success and overcoming struggles in the music industry does not reflect the specific joy and thrill of attending a significant event like the finals. Contextually, the song's themes of career achievement and personal victories do not match the sports-related excitement of the user's prompt. The lyrics, while somewhat coherent in expressing the artist's journey and success, are repetitive and lack a clear, consistent narrative that could enhance the emotional and contextual relevance to the user's situation."
Walking past that abandoned lot at night makes my pulse race.,and 6 am in morningside the first car rushes by we walk down to the garden and the sunlight fills your eyes and stops me for a moment till i turn and look the other way the windows are all open and it s saturday and where i ride the evening turns to blue and fades away a silence hangs enchanted through sunset and the lane the air is charged with sunlight and your name is ringing through my mind cathedral bells and sunlit is the night,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song lyrics provided do not strongly align with the user's emotional state of feeling a racing pulse while walking past an abandoned lot at night. The emotional alignment score is 2 because the lyrics evoke a sense of calm and beauty, contrasting with the user's feeling of anxiety or fear. The contextual relevance score is 1 as the lyrics describe serene and peaceful daytime scenes, which starkly differ from the nighttime, eerie context of the prompt. The lyrical coherence score is 3 because the lyrics are somewhat poetic and create a vivid imagery, though they lack a clear narrative structure. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs, resulting in an overall score of 2."
A stranger held the door while I juggled coffee and my laptop—brightened my morning.,i looked you up and down i liked everything i saw from the fragile outline of your hips to the trembling movements in your jaw but then the coffee cup shattered on the kitchen floor you said that you couldn t take it anymore i knew you were leaving i knew you were going to bristol i watched you pack your bags saw you head up to the door but when the key broke off in the deadbolt lock you said that you couldn t take it anymore that was the second time you said that in one day why don t you just sit still it s going to be ok going to bristol going to bristol going to bristol going to bristol,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional and contextual prompt. The user's experience was a small, positive moment of kindness, whereas the song discusses a stressful and emotional situation of a breakup and leaving. This creates a disconnect in both emotional alignment and contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, telling a clear story, but they do not match the simplicity and positivity of the user's moment."
Scrolled past an old voicemail from her and suddenly the room felt empty.,the buzzing of the house has disappeared the glow is dimmed and contact s lost voices faces who were here the corner of the room was on and nothing else was needed no one else required nothing happens now it s all gone quiet for all intents for all our trust what was ever true the daily grind it sprang to life watching what was on instead of watching out the hours and hours and time to change i realise i m one of all the same but when i see you soon remind me how you lit up every room you knew that you were needed you talked and never tired how does it feel now that you ve been retired ,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of emptiness and loss, aligning well with the user's emotional state of feeling the room empty upon encountering a reminder of someone from the past. This scores high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on themes of absence and silence, which resonates with the user's experience of a sudden void, though it diverges into broader reflections on life and change, slightly reducing its contextual relevance. The lyrics, while evocative, are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative flow, impacting their coherence and making them less effective in conveying a concise message."
My balcony tomatoes finally turned bright yellow today—couldn’t stop smiling.,and how i know i m happy now i jump right down the shoots of time and yes the weather was not always grey but the furrow always grazed my brow mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm now i m overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light yes we had some hard work but now it s right overcome with light overcome and my worries then were not grand but i felt them like a hammer pounding like i really feel feel them now and in a pinch i know i m dreaming mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm now i m overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light yes we had some scrapes but now it s right overcome with light overcome overcome with light overcome with light overcome,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song's repeated theme of being 'overcome with light' aligns well with the user's feeling of joy and satisfaction from seeing their tomatoes turn bright yellow, which is a light and bright imagery. This gives the song a high score in emotional alignment. However, the contextual relevance is lower because the song's broader themes of overcoming past struggles and hardships don't directly relate to the simple, joyful act of gardening. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and abstract, but they maintain a consistent theme and are emotionally expressive, which provides a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
He doodled a silly sketch of us on the fridge; totally melted my heart.,you looked liked pingu in the igloo your nose was cold you showed me the icicle that you found hanging from the roof i remember your entrance to the room i was in and the half pint glass you were holding that made you look bigger than you were you drew a charming stick man on my left hand and you told me not to wash it off we loved you we loved you,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a tender and playful interaction, similar to the emotional tone of the user's prompt about a heartwarming doodle. The emotional alignment is strong as both the song and the prompt share themes of affection and charming gestures. Contextually, the song mentions a drawing on the hand, which is somewhat relevant to the doodle on the fridge, but it's not a direct match, hence a moderate score. The lyrics are somewhat poetic and maintain a good flow, making them coherent and easy to follow, though they might require a bit of interpretation to fully grasp the connection to the prompt."
Waiting outside the dentist’s room; my knee won’t stop bouncing.,bad blood saturating the sheets and the blankets good god there are ghosts floating up from the pavement they flip over the houses blood runs out from the basements in its unholy flow you remember this whimpering thick nauseous feeling from your step brother chasing you around with a staple gun when you were young it was fun and then suddenly pain became a very real thing do you remember that feeling similarly this isnt fiction well actually mostly it is or a series of irl moments cloaked in the vagueness that songs give but when theres nothing to say and youve got to say something fuck i dont even know we pass on the street and say hi cause we have to even though both of us are clearly just like i fucking hate you so stilted and silent not awkward just angry hey i gotta go but ill see you at the show its that song everybody loves but the are garbage and it stresses me out how often youre mentioned its like everyone we know collectively vomited up a pile of brown sweaters or something and were so impressed with the results that they put them on the wall and im so sad youre in my head and im so sorry its so venomous especially because weve got like maybe four or five words ever spoken between us but i cant heave my heart into my mouth i cant tell you i cant stop you i dont want to this first day of school shit just seems to keep happening everybody says man its so cool were so glad youre doing your own thing but worse than disdain is colossal indifference the smiles are so big and theres no one at the gig im either deep in the woods or on tv for everyone and i know its disgusting how much i think about myself in relation to nothing the things that arent gonna stay just arent gonna stay like i was getting a tooth pulled in the free clinic in portland in 2007 the dentist turned out to be this dude a drummer whose band id recorded and somehow that was comforting then the novocaine block kicked in it closed up my throat and i was ready to go home maybe once this record comes out then i can stop drinking that might look good on a press release or something if they even still do those wait im certain they still do those and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.33,"The recommended song lyrics do not align well with the user's emotional state of nervous anticipation while waiting outside the dentist's room. The song's emotional tone is more chaotic and filled with anger and frustration, which does not match the user's likely feelings of anxiety or nervousness. Contextually, there is a brief mention of a dentist, which provides a slight connection to the user's situation, but it is not the main focus of the song. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and difficult to follow, lacking coherence and a clear narrative, making it hard for the user to find solace or relevance in them during their wait."

The emotional alignment score is 2 because the song's primary focus on being overwhelmed and missing out on social life doesn't directly mirror the user's specific emotional blend of rejection and optimism. Contextually, the song scores a 3 as it touches on the theme of balancing work and personal life, which can be loosely related to the user's situation of handling career-related challenges. The lyrics are quite coherent, maintaining a consistent theme and narrative, which justifies a coherence score of 4. The overall score is 3, indicating a moderate match, as the song captures the essence of being caught up in work but does not perfectly reflect the user's current emotional and situational context."

However, the song primarily focuses on enjoying solitude and personal chores rather than celebrating a specific achievement or physical activity, which weakens its contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack fluency, affecting the coherence score. Overall, while there are elements of emotional alignment, the song does not strongly resonate with the specific context of the user's achievement in running, nor does it provide a coherent narrative."
"Realised the meeting invite said 7 a.m., not p.m.—no wonder no one joined.",not submitted,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Without the recommended song lyrics, it is impossible to evaluate how well the song matches the user's emotional and contextual prompt.

Boxed up the holiday decorations; the living room looks strangely empty.,christmas time is here again it don t seem so different when last year which was filled with emptiness all around directionless,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's emotional alignment scores a 3 as it captures a sense of emptiness and a lack of direction, which resonates with the user's feeling of the living room looking 'strangely empty' after removing holiday decorations. Contextually, the song scores a 4 because it directly references the holiday season, aligning well with the user's activity of boxing up holiday decorations. However, the lyrical coherence scores a 2 due to the somewhat disjointed and vague expression of the lyrics, which could make it harder for the user to fully connect with the song's message."
Opened the fridge and found a note that read ‘road trip tomorrow!’—didn’t see that coming.,yesterday alone i laid everything out on the carpet books kitchen things objects with specific purpose or none arranged them sideways in a grid on the floor there unmoored out of context and then considered it first the whole picture then everything individually humming along at the deadest pace imaginable one object then another and then the next and i wondered what they meant there if they meant anything still found notes camping supplies a book you bought in the desert identifying wildflowers pictures from vacations from parties kitschy gifts we bought from rest stops on that road trip out west objects everything itself and then memory all of it laid out there from the dining room the living room the hallway and the basement and the kitchen from that room we called the office but never used even the bathroom everything laid out there on the floor on the carpet out of context and i sat there for hours today i moved everything from the floor to the table in the dining room placed each thing carefully without reason or at least without one i understood or could describe there on the table together and when i was done and stepped back i realized what i had made keepsakes pictures letters ordinary objects all collected there a memorial and i thought of ones on highways or set by gravestones all the things you see there but dont understand but still bring a remembered thing back vividly invoke someones reality when there together in that place in that way out of context and i knew i had to take it down before anybody else saw tomorrow i plan to put them all somewhere those things in boxes side of the road attic maybe all these things that push and pull me through history to places i once was places i mightve gone places i ended up going postcards ticket stubs from one thing or another a personalized coffee mug neither your name nor mine phone cards and old phones a page from an old calendar i bought once at a thrift store and insisted on hanging that cycles of the moon print photos old boots of mine put them in boxes and i sat there for hours in the living room first then in the dining room moving things around picking things up and seeing where they took me to what place in history what moment on our timeline where we were where i was where i thought wed end up in this house or on the highway driving somewhere near christmas in the desert or anywhere else and i put them in boxes6,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,"The recommended song lyrics capture a sense of unexpectedness and reflection, aligning somewhat with the emotional surprise of a sudden road trip found in the user's prompt. The context of sorting through memories and objects, some of which are related to road trips, provides a decent thematic link to the idea of a spontaneous journey. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low; the lyrics are presented in a stream-of-consciousness style without clear structure, making them challenging to follow. This impacts the overall effectiveness of the song in conveying a clear and engaging narrative or theme related to the user's initial surprise and the ensuing adventure."
Watching my sister patiently guide my nephew through his first steps left me amazed by her dedication.,i m watchin sis go pitterpat said i can do that i can do that knew ev ry step right off the bat said i can do that i can do that one morning sis won t go to dance class i grab her shoes and tights and all but my foot s too small so i stuff her shoes with extra socks run seven blocks in nothin flat hell i can do that i can do that i got to class and had it made and so i stayed the rest of my life all thanks to sis i can do this that i can do i can do that ,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of admiration and inspiration similar to the user's emotion of amazement at their sister's dedication. However, the song focuses more on the narrator's own journey and achievements inspired by their sister, rather than the sister's dedication itself, which slightly misaligns with the user's focus. Contextually, the song involves a sibling relationship and a learning process, which loosely connects to the user's scenario of a sister teaching a nephew. The lyrics, while energetic and narrative, are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, affecting their overall coherence and clarity in conveying a complete story or emotion."
I just finished a comedy movie and found myself laughing out loud through the entire end credits.,on my own in the back thought of death made me laugh summer s sun a sinking hole we were young and passionate we were young,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of joy and amusement after watching a comedy movie. The mention of 'death' and 'sinking hole' in the lyrics introduces a somber or melancholic tone, which contrasts sharply with the laughter and light-heartedness described in the prompt. Contextually, the song's theme of reminiscing about youth and passion does not connect with the comedic and uplifting experience of the user. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear narrative or fluency, making it difficult to grasp a solid storyline or theme. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."
"I just returned to my desk and found my meticulously organized files shredded and scattered everywhere, and I was absolutely furious.",got me fucked up,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics 'got me fucked up' do capture a sense of frustration or anger, which aligns somewhat with the user's emotion of fury. However, the lyrics are extremely brief and lack depth, providing no context or further exploration of the situation or feelings, which makes them very limited in contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is also low due to the lack of substance and clarity in the message. Overall, the song does not adequately address the user's emotional state or the specific context of finding their organized files destroyed."

The song's focus on loneliness and the imagery of a damaged front door does not reflect the specific annoyance and disturbance described in the prompt. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative, making them only moderately coherent. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional or contextual needs, resulting in a low overall score."
"After staying up all night finishing that report, hearing my manager praise my work in the morning convinced me i’d made the right call.",listen to the sound listen to the sound everything always works out,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics 'listen to the sound listen to the sound everything always works out' align well with the emotional relief and affirmation the user felt after receiving praise from their manager. This reflects a positive and reassuring emotion, similar to the user's experience. Contextually, the lyrics are somewhat relevant as they convey a general sense of things turning out well, which matches the user's outcome of their hard work being recognized. However, the lyrics do not specifically address the context of working hard or staying up all night. The lyrics are coherent and simple, effectively conveying a message of optimism and reassurance, though they are somewhat repetitive and lack depth."
"My brother felt terrible all night, so I stayed by his side and made sure he had everything he needed.",oh brother brother brother i know you ve been laying back a long time but i love you like no other oh brother brother brother i ve been watching everything you do and i ve been wishing only good for you all you ve got to do is just want it to and it s gonna come to you you have always been so good to me and though you didn t always talk to me there wasn t much my loving eyes could not see and i don t believe you need all your misery ,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics reflect a deep emotional connection and support towards a brother, aligning well with the user's situation of caring for their brother. The emotional alignment scores high as the lyrics express love, support, and a desire for the brother's well-being, resonating with the user's feelings of care and concern. Contextually, the song fits as it addresses a brotherly relationship, though it focuses more on an emotional perspective rather than the specific scenario of caring during illness. The lyrics are coherent and fluent, maintaining a consistent theme of brotherly love and support throughout the song."
Receiving an urgent call from my doctor asking me to come in immediately without any details left me completely uncertain about what was wrong.,the doctor came in the morning she held my hand and asked was it worth it could it be worse than this please recall give me a hint anything will do if this was the last time now you should tell us what to do i was afraid i guess now i can t think no more i was so concentrated on keeping things together i ve learned to focus on i didn t want to disappoint now where is everybody is it still light outside 1,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song captures the emotional turmoil and uncertainty experienced by someone who receives an unsettling call from their doctor, aligning well with the user's emotional state. The lyrics express fear, confusion, and a desire for answers, which resonate with the user's feelings of uncertainty about their health. However, the song's context isn't perfectly aligned with the specific scenario of being called into the doctor's office as it seems to delve into broader themes of existential anxiety and seeking guidance. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but can be perceived as disjointed or abstract, which might affect the listener's ability to fully connect with the message. Overall, the song does a good job of reflecting the user's emotional state but could be more contextually specific and lyrically clear."
I just uncovered a major secret hidden in the archives and can’t stop wondering what else I’ll find.,well i was ready to walk into your heart i ll make believe there s something i ve lost but i think you know what i ve done oh i think you know i ll be your surprise it s just a secret that s alwasy on display or just a memory you can t throw away oh i ll be your surprise,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song's lyrics touch on themes of secrets and surprises, which aligns somewhat with the user's emotional state of uncovering a major secret. However, the emotional intensity and curiosity expressed in the user's prompt about discovering more is not strongly reflected in the song, leading to a moderate score in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song mentions secrets but does not delve into the aspect of discovery or the thrill of uncovering something hidden, which results in a lower score for contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative, making it difficult to follow a coherent story or message, thus receiving a lower score in lyrical coherence."

The emotional alignment is low as the song's focus on wealth and swagger does not reflect the user's excitement and longing related to cooking. The contextual relevance is slightly higher due to the mention of cheese, which is a cooking ingredient, but still largely irrelevant to making a chocolate dessert. The lyrical coherence is low as the lyrics are highly repetitive and lack depth or variety, making them less engaging and meaningful in relation to the user's cooking enthusiasm."
"I opened the email to see that tonight’s concert had been canceled, leaving me utterly let down.",i dropped my book and saw a face her hair red my feelings cold i just can t feel anything anymore funerals are for the living but i can t quite die i really want to go but i will miss music like this and i would forever wonder if everything would turn out okay in the end come on we all die in the end but at times i want to die in the middle but now now i think it s the end,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.

However, the context of the song, which seems to revolve around a personal relationship and emotional breakdown, only partially matches the user's situation regarding a community event. The lyrics are fluent and convey a clear sense of disillusionment and loss, which makes them relatively coherent. Overall, the song captures some of the user's emotional state but does not fully align with the specific context of a canceled community class."

However, the song's emphasis on deciding where to eat next and listing various fast food options does not align well with the user's situation of food spoilage and the associated nausea. The lyrics are somewhat coherent as they maintain a consistent theme of dealing with hunger by choosing different eating establishments, but they lack a clear, structured narrative. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional state of feeling sick from bad food, nor does it address the context of food spoilage, focusing instead on choices for eating out."
I just waved enthusiastically at someone who wasn’t waving at me and wanted to disappear on the spot.,last night i saw someone with your eyes someone with your smile someone with your smile we danced and though glad that she had asked me to she didnt have your arms,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.5,"The song's emotional alignment with the user's prompt is low, as it does not directly address the feeling of embarrassment or the desire to disappear, which are central to the user's experience. Instead, it talks about dancing with someone who resembles another person, which is tangentially related at best. The contextual relevance is also low because the song's scenario of dancing with someone who resembles a past acquaintance does not match the user's situation of an awkward social misunderstanding. The lyrical coherence is moderate, as the lyrics are somewhat clear and tell a coherent story, but they do not align well with the user's emotional or contextual needs."
I just found out my best friend is flying in for a surprise visit and I can’t stop smiling.,i got a big surprise when i saw you smile i never dreamed that it could be but now i realize since i saw you smile there s only happiness for me so bye bye blues bye bye blues bells ring birds sing sun is shining no more pining just we two smiling thru don t sigh don t cry bye bye blues blues,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The song perfectly captures the emotion of happiness and surprise as reflected in the user's prompt about their best friend's unexpected visit. The lyrics 'i got a big surprise when i saw you smile' directly align with the user's experience of joy and surprise, scoring a 5 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song fits well with the theme of a joyful reunion, though it speaks more generally about happiness rather than specifically about friends reuniting, thus earning a 4. The lyrics are coherent and flow well, conveying a clear message of shedding sadness for joy, which earns a 4 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's emotional state and context, providing a cheerful and uplifting response to the situation."
"I just got word my friend is driving here through this raging thunderstorm, and each crack of thunder sent a chill down my spine.",we are in the storm ,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics 'we are in the storm' somewhat align with the emotional aspect of the user's prompt, capturing the literal presence of a storm. However, it fails to reflect the deeper emotional undertones of worry and fear for a friend's safety during a dangerous situation. Contextually, the lyrics are minimally relevant as they only mention the storm but do not address the specific scenario of a friend driving or the user's emotional response to the thunder. The lyrics provided are too brief and lack sufficient detail or development, resulting in a low coherence score. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."
"I came home after a long day to find my partner had cleaned up and cooked dinner, and it made me realize how lucky I am to have them.",i woke up today i strapped my shoes on tight it s gonna be a long day i won t be home till tonight i m going out to the lake to see what i can bring in if anybody needs me tell them i ve gone fishing it seems like yesterday was lost but now i m found i ve got a great job that pays to spread god s joy around many have been lead astray i ll tell them what they ve been missing jesus is the only way and that s why i ve gone fishing i ve gone fishing i ve gone fishing ,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of feeling grateful and lucky for their partner's thoughtful actions. The song's theme revolves around fishing and finding personal solace and purpose, which does not match the context of domestic appreciation and partnership. The lyrics themselves are coherent and follow a clear narrative about finding purpose and spreading joy, but they do not relate to the user's situation of coming home to a caring gesture. Therefore, the song scores low on emotional alignment and contextual relevance, but moderately on lyrical coherence."
"I just found my grandmother’s favorite shawl tucked in her chair, and tears welled up as I remembered her warmth.",i walked through the door with you the air was cold but something bout it felt like home somehow and i left my scarf there at your sister s house and you ve still got it in your drawer even now oh your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze we re singing in the car getting lost upstate autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place and i can picture it after all these days and i know it s long gone and that magic s not here no more and i might be okay but i m not fine at all oh oh oh cause there we are again on that little town street you almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me wind in my hair i was there i remember it all too well photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed and your mother s telling stories bout you on the tee ball team you taught me bout your past thinking your future was me and i know it s long gone and there was nothing else i could do and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to cause there we are again in the middle of the night we re dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light down the stairs i was there i remember it all too well yeah  well maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much but maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up running scared i was there i remember it all too well and you call me up again just to break me like a promise so casually cruel in the name of being honest i m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here cause i remember it all all all too well time won t fly it s like i m paralyzed by it i d like to be my old self again but i m still trying to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now you mail back my things and i walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from that very first week cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me you can t get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah cause there we are again when i loved you so back before you lost the one real thing you ve ever known it was rare i was there i remember it all too well wind in my hair you were there you remember it all down the stairs you were there you remember it all it was rare i was there i remember it all too well146,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"The song 'All Too Well' by Taylor Swift captures a deep sense of nostalgia and loss, which aligns emotionally with the user's feelings of missing a loved one, as reflected in the prompt about remembering a grandmother. However, the song primarily focuses on a romantic relationship and the memories associated with it, which makes it less contextually relevant to the user's experience related to family and the memory of a grandmother. The lyrics are fluent and tell a coherent story, making them easy to follow and understand, hence a higher score in lyrical coherence. Overall, while the song resonates on an emotional level to some extent, its specific narrative and theme do not perfectly align with the user's context, resulting in a moderate overall score."
"I opened my inbox this morning to find I’d received my scholarship award, and I can’t stop grinning from ear to ear.",i think i saw ol santa through my window christmas eve my eyes were really droopy but i really do believe it must ve been ol santa cause i saw his big red hat and i know my mom and dad can t fly like that oh no and then i heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door the same ol christmas trick my dad had played since i was four he stands outside my bedroom yelling ho ho ho because he knows i don t believe in santa claus no way i think my daddy sees me peeking from my door but he pretends he s santa anyway every year he tries to fool me but i m a big boy now i don t believe in santa or his sleigh no way so i went back to my bed and i curled up nice and tight i stared out of my window and i looked into the night and then all of a sudden through my window i could see santa claus was flying by and smiling at me santa claus santa claus it must ve been ol santa claus santa claus santa claus happy ho ho ho to you and then i heard ol rudolph tellin me to come outside he told me that ol santa wanted me to take a ride i climbed out of my window and i jumped onto his sleigh and then ol santa took me up and away  we flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below i saw my big red school house and the town square picture show it was really past my bedtime and so ol santa said little boys like you should be in bed so i hollered ho ho ho and i put on santa s hat then he let me hold the reins a while we pulled up to my window and i jumped back in my room and i waved goodbye to santa with a smile when i woke up christmas morning well it was clear and bright my parents said my window had blown open in the night i smiled as i told them that it must ve been the cat and they asked me where i got my big red hat yeah yeah c mon santa claus santa claus it must ve been ol santa claus santa claus santa claus happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you one more again,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song primarily revolves around a Christmas theme, focusing on a child's interaction with Santa Claus and the magic of the holiday season. This does not align with the user's emotional state of joy and achievement related to receiving a scholarship award. The emotional alignment and contextual relevance both score very low as the song's theme and the user's situation are unrelated. The lyrics themselves are coherent and tell a clear, if whimsical, story about a child's Christmas experience, which is why the coherence score is moderate. Overall, the song does not match the user's current emotional and contextual needs."
"I woke up this morning to find a bouquet of flowers on my nightstand with a note that said ‘just because’, and my heart melted.",at this point in my life clearly i can see all the gifts he bestowed upon me that is why deep inside i have this joy there was once a time my soul was searching to find a place to nest now in this joy i can rest now my heart holds the love he has given me and that s all that i ll ever need to live believe and spread his love i m so glad i have this joy,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a deep sense of joy and gratitude, which aligns well with the user's emotional state of feeling touched and loved, as indicated by the surprise bouquet. However, the context of the song, which seems to focus on spiritual love and gratitude towards a divine figure, does not directly align with the romantic or affectionate gesture described in the user's prompt. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, though they could be clearer in conveying a specific narrative or message. Overall, while the song captures the emotion of joy and gratitude, it diverges in its thematic focus from the personal, intimate context of the user's experience."
"I just sat down to record my podcast and realized I hadn’t rehearsed my opening lines, and I felt my palms grow clammy.",and i have grown i have could ve sworn i have for long i was certain that i saw it clear i am you then your sweaty palms surround it and i have grown i have could ve sworn i had but i forgot that i ever really was here heaving with all my might hear the lightning through the sky heaving with all my might hear the lightning through this for long i was certain that i saw it clear i am you than your sweaty palms surrounded but i forgot that i was ever really was here ,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,"The song lyrics mention 'sweaty palms,' which aligns somewhat with the user's emotional state of nervousness and anxiety. However, the rest of the lyrics are disjointed and lack a clear narrative or theme that relates to the user's situation of preparing for a podcast. The lyrics are very incoherent, making it difficult to derive a meaningful connection or message. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs, primarily due to the lack of coherence and limited contextual relevance."
I just watched the sunrise break through the clouds and felt sure today would bring new opportunities.,yeah just when i had the money to spend and i was always thinking it would never end then the time came to the end of the game don t you know and just when the sky got shiny and bright there never seemed to be an end of the light but then the clouds came it started to rain don t you know just when it was going just when it was going so good just when it just when it was going so good but just when the highway straightened out for a mile and i was thinking i d just cruise for a while a fork in the road bought a new episode don t you know baby don t you worry i said baby don t you cry we re going to get it together and i know you re asking why yeah just when baby,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of change and unexpected turns, which aligns somewhat with the theme of new opportunities as mentioned in the user's prompt. However, the song primarily focuses on the end of good times and the onset of challenges, which contrasts with the optimistic and hopeful tone of the user's experience watching the sunrise. Contextually, the song does not specifically relate to the imagery of a sunrise or the explicit expectation of new opportunities, making it only marginally relevant. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear progression, which affects their coherence and the overall alignment with the user's emotional and contextual needs."
I just saw my project showcased in the company newsletter and couldn’t help but beam at what I’d accomplished.,i am a very important person i ve acquired a genetically altered handshake capable of speeds up to thirty miles an hour hair arranged by the most advanced landscape surveillance operators our company can afford i have a very expensive pen i use big words quite often in substitution for semantically equivalent words i attribute this success to my professional demeanor and my strong stock portfolio though it may not appear so i am quite comfortable in my surroundings i have everything let me show you around smile you fucker it s not often you get this chance love is just an exchange of corporate documents i ve reviewed your rapport and i feel you re a prospect for mechanical salvation this is a joint venture that will be mutually advantageous to both parties involved technically this is just a business merger a consolidation of liquid assets we are respectively geared towards customer service there is a great possibility for corporate sponsorship if you re willing i am sure we could synchronize agendas swift and efficient satisfaction oh satisfaction baby oh come on through innovative planning we could form a strong strategic partnership capable of overcoming sensitive and adverse predicaments which will be discussed at the next goals assessment meeting promotion possibility and additional benefits are diagrammed in my preliminary objective outline raises are granted based on performance,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics focus on corporate culture and business jargon, which somewhat aligns with the user's experience of professional accomplishment. However, the emotional tone of the song, which is sarcastic and critical of corporate life, does not match the user's positive and proud emotions about their project being showcased. The lyrics are coherent in their own context but might be confusing due to the heavy use of corporate satire and jargon. Overall, the song does not effectively resonate with the user's feelings of joy and pride, nor does it appropriately celebrate the user's personal achievement."
"I just found an old photo of my childhood home tucked away in a drawer, and it made me realize how far I’ve come.",there s an old kodak camera in my dresser drawer i ran across it just this afternoon and i realized that i don t ever use it anymore in fact last time i did i think it was with you when we were down in cozumel we had the whole beach to ourselves and it s crazy now to think that it s all there on that film and i could take it to the store to be developed but what for i can still see everything just fine and who needs pictures with a memory like mine standing there i couldn t help but think about everything that might be on that roll i think it even has another trip we took i guess that must ve been at least three years ago when we were down in baton rouge and there wasn t much to do so we drove into new orleans every afternoon and i swear that you would think that it was only yesterday cause i can still see everything just fine who needs pictures with a memory like mine somewhere in my closet there s a cardboard box just sitting on a shelf it s full of faded memories and it s been there ever since the night you left oh just forgotten photographs to remind me of the past oh but i can still see everything just fine who needs pictures with a memory like mine yeah who needs pictures with a memory like mine,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,"The song 'Who Needs Pictures' by Brad Paisley resonates well with the user's emotional state of nostalgia and reflection upon seeing an old photo of their childhood home. The lyrics discuss the discovery of an old camera and the memories captured in unseen photographs, paralleling the user's experience with the found photo. The contextual relevance is excellent as the song directly addresses the theme of revisiting old memories through physical objects, aligning perfectly with the user's situation. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear, evocative story about memories and the passage of time, though some repetitions slightly affect the fluency. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's emotional and contextual needs, providing a reflective and nostalgic atmosphere."
"I just got the call that my test results came back clear, and I felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders.",let me down now i m falling off the line and i can feel it crawling through my spine because in my room now i feel so divine not a worry running through my mind,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of relief and freedom from worry, which aligns well with the user's emotion of feeling a 'huge weight lift off their shoulders' after receiving good news about their test results. This scores a 4 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the lyrics somewhat fit the theme of relief and newfound peace, scoring a 3, as the specifics of the situation (test results) are not mentioned. The lyrics are moderately coherent, presenting a clear feeling of liberation, though the imagery and expressions are somewhat abstract, leading to a score of 3 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song captures the essence of the user's emotional state but could be more directly relevant to the specific context of receiving test results."

The emotional alignment is excellent as the song captures the grief and the complex feelings surrounding a father's death. Contextually, the song is highly relevant as it directly addresses the experience of a father's passing and the aftermath of dealing with that loss, matching the user's situation. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear, poignant story about the relationship and feelings towards a deceased father, though some abstract phrases slightly reduce clarity. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's emotional and contextual needs."
"I just discovered a heartfelt letter from my childhood friend tucked inside an old book, and I was completely caught off guard.",this is the letter that i wrote before see in those words i wrote i had no fear yeah i was about 10 years old and uh it was christmas day i remember waking up looking at myself and thinking how amazing it is to be what an amazing feel that is but you do forget you know this is what i m coming for more ,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song captures the emotional essence of nostalgia and surprise, similar to the user's experience of finding a heartfelt letter from a childhood friend. The mention of reflecting on past feelings aligns well with the user's emotional state. However, the context of the song, focusing on a specific Christmas memory and self-reflection, only partially matches the user's scenario of discovering a letter. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack fluency, making it difficult to fully grasp the narrative or emotional depth, which affects the coherence score."

The emotional alignment is low because the song expresses more concern and worry rather than admiration and aspiration. Contextually, the song does mention a brother and hopes for him, which somewhat fits the theme of looking up to a brother but in a more negative and protective sense rather than inspirational. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent narrative about concern for the brother's well-being and future, though the themes of violence and ghosts might confuse the intended message of brotherly admiration."

The context of a live performance and the humorous nature of the content perfectly match the user's experience of watching a concert that was entertaining, thus scoring a 5 in contextual relevance. The coherence of the lyrics, however, is slightly disjointed due to the rapid shift in topics and the stand-up comedy style, which might make it a bit harder to follow, resulting in a score of 3. Overall, the song does a good job of matching the user's emotional state and context, with some deductions for lyrical coherence."

The lyrics express a sense of mistrust and self-doubt, resonating with the user's frustration about being hurt by someone they trusted. Contextually, the song scores a 3 as it deals with themes of trust and personal reflection, which are relevant but not directly addressing the act of being hurt by someone else, rather focusing on the singer's own reliability and history. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, scoring a 4, as they convey a clear narrative of self-reflection and emotional exhaustion, though the structure is slightly fragmented which might affect the overall fluency."
"There’s this person I deal with regularly, and the way he speaks just really irritates me. I don’t know why it gets to me so much.",i m so frustrated some things are making me so sick inside aw go with your heart go with your heart yeah right quit tugging me aw i m just not good enough for you let s change let s be something we re not let s be something everybody else is ah so much built up inside it s fucking ridiculous i don t know if i should freak the fuck out on you or just sit back and laugh you want more you don t have anything me me i have everything yeah i have everything what more could i ask for nothing at all why did it have to be this way at the end why did it have to be this way at the end 1,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song chosen reflects a high level of frustration and irritation, aligning well with the user's emotional state regarding their annoyance with a person's speech. This scores a 4 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song addresses interpersonal conflict and emotional turmoil, which is somewhat relevant to the user's situation, scoring a 3. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low, scoring a 2, as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and chaotic, which might reflect the emotional state but does not contribute to a clear or fluent message. Overall, the song moderately addresses the user's feelings and context but struggles with clarity in its expression."
Someone at work has been handling things incredibly well. I just wanted to say I genuinely respect how he manages everything.,he is a mighty good god for him there s nothing to hard there is no problem he can t solve he is the lord of all in him i find no fault in him there is no failure in him i will not lack he is the lord of all in you i find no fault in you there is no failure in you i will not lack you are the lord of all you are the lord of all yes you are yes you are you are the lord of all ,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's lyrics focus on praising and acknowledging the omnipotence and perfection of a divine figure, which only partially aligns with the user's intent to appreciate a colleague's professional capabilities. Emotional alignment scores a 2 as the song conveys a sense of respect and admiration, similar to the user's feelings, but it is directed towards a divine entity rather than a human's professional skills. Contextually, the song scores a 1 because it is more spiritually oriented rather than about workplace or professional admiration. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive but maintain a clear theme of praise, earning a coherence score of 3. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's prompt about workplace respect and management."
"I’ve been taking care of a little bunny for a couple of years, and I feel so responsible for his well-being. He means a lot to me.",you know that i care what happens to you and i know that you care for me so i don t feel alone or the weight of the stone now that i ve found somewhere safe to bury my bone and any fool knows a dog needs a home a shelter from pigs on the wing,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of care and responsibility, aligning well with the user's emotional state regarding their attachment and duty towards their bunny. The mention of caring and not feeling alone resonates with the user's feelings. However, the contextual relevance is lower as the lyrics specifically mention a dog, which is a different context from caring for a bunny. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, but the references to 'pigs on the wing' and 'bury my bone' might confuse the user, as these phrases do not directly relate to the theme of caring for a pet bunny."
I just got here and I feel completely disoriented. I don’t understand what’s going on or what I’m supposed to be doing.,i don t know who you think you are i don t know what you re doing here i don t know what s going on here i don t know how it s supposed to be i i don t have the vaguest notion whose it is what it s all for i don t know i m not crying laughin mostly as you can see,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics strongly resonate with the user's feelings of disorientation and confusion, as reflected in the repeated expressions of not knowing what's happening or what is expected ('i don t know what you re doing here', 'i don t know what s going on here'). This aligns well emotionally, scoring a 4. Contextually, the lyrics fit the theme of disorientation but lack a direct connection to a specific scenario or resolution, leading to a score of 3. The coherence of the lyrics is somewhat fragmented and repetitive, which might mirror the confusion but makes it harder to follow a clear narrative, resulting in a score of 2. Overall, the song captures the essence of the user's emotional state but could benefit from more clarity and context."

Contextually, the song touches on noticing changes and wanting to explore deeper connections, which loosely relates to the user's desire to dive into new topics, earning a score of 3. However, the lyrical coherence of the song is somewhat disjointed and lacks clear fluency, making it harder to follow, resulting in a score of 2. Overall, the song partially matches the user's prompt but could be improved in coherence for better clarity and relevance."
"More than anything right now, I just want to grow and improve. I want to become someone I can be proud of.",we can pretend who we can be a dancer in a top hat or a captain of the sea i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics resonate well with the user's desire for personal growth and self-improvement, as it emphasizes being oneself and embracing individuality ('I just want to be myself for everyone to see'). This aligns closely with the user's emotional state of wanting to become someone they can be proud of, reflecting a journey towards self-acceptance and authenticity. Contextually, the song fits as it discusses themes of self-identity and personal expression, which are relevant to the user's aspirations of self-improvement. However, the lyrical coherence is slightly lower as the repetitive nature and simplistic structure might not fully convey the depth of the user's emotional and aspirational complexity. Overall, the song is quite fitting but could benefit from more nuanced and varied lyrics to better capture the user's sentiments."
"I thought I could rely on someone close to me, but they let me down again. It hurts more than I expected.",when she sat me down just to tell me i m alone again the only thing i thought was that i don t need any friends cause they re all living in my head and things will never be the same but i don t think i d have it any other way and my thoughts haven t really changed the only thing i can t figure out is who s to blame for all my selfish deeds undone i guess that i m the only one who knows that in the end i didn t try hard enough i can t wait to die alone,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song's lyrics reflect a strong sense of betrayal and loneliness, aligning well with the user's feelings of being let down by someone close. This scores high in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song delves into themes of isolation and self-blame, which partially matches the user's situation of disappointment in a trusted individual, though it veers towards a more extreme resolution of wanting to 'die alone,' which might not perfectly resonate with the user's current emotional state. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, expressing a clear narrative of personal realization and regret, though the flow and clarity could be improved for better understanding."
"I tried to accept things the way they are, but I can’t anymore. I don’t agree with what’s happening, and I think I need to walk away.",it s not like it hasn t come to this point before but it seems like you mean it when you walk that way no it don t please me to quit this easy but there s the door you know you d be better off if you stay babe babe babe please turn around babe babe babe baby don t turn it down it s not a thing like me to beg and plead but i m just at a loss for words to say you got me spitting out things that i don t believe cause you keep hitting pause and i wanna play babe babe babe please turn around babe babe babe baby don t turn it down turn around turn around turn around babe babe babe please turn around babe babe babe baby don t turn it down  turn around turn around turn around,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song captures a sense of reluctance and frustration similar to the user's feelings about needing to walk away, which aligns somewhat with the emotional aspect of the prompt. However, the song seems to focus more on pleading for someone to stay rather than the decision to leave, which doesn't fully match the user's context of deciding to walk away due to disagreement. The lyrics are repetitive and somewhat disjointed, lacking fluency and clear narrative progression, which affects the coherence score."

I told someone I liked them and their friends laughed at me. Now I can’t stop feeling ashamed.,you came around with your eyes dancing down and we never even talked that much embarrassingly enough i asked your friends where the hell you been well they really shut me down but i didn t stop looking around let me be right there let me in let me be right there1,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song captures the emotion of embarrassment and rejection which aligns well with the user's feelings of shame after being laughed at. The context of seeking acceptance and dealing with rejection is relevant, though not a perfect match as the song seems to focus more on persistence in seeking connection rather than dealing with the aftermath of rejection. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack fluency, making it harder to fully grasp the narrative or emotional depth, which affects the coherence score."
My new air fryer arrives in only a week! I want to use it right now!,boy i got my fire satisfy my desire i know you want it too right now right now boy i go on fire make me hotter than air i know you re feeling it too right now,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the user's emotional state or the context of the prompt. The user expresses excitement and anticipation about receiving a new air fryer, which is a specific and domestic context. The lyrics, however, seem to focus on themes of desire and immediate gratification in a more intimate or romantic sense, which does not match the user's situation. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative, leading to a lower score in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song does not effectively reflect the user's emotions or the context of their excitement about a new kitchen appliance."
"I had a terrifying moment recently—my whole body froze, and I felt like something horrible was about to happen.",i haven t felt this way in a long time and it scares me what are these voices that tell me that i m ugly and fake and i think they might be right i m nothing and i have no heart it s quite possibly i have no soul drugs can t help me anymore and i think i m dying we re both dying really but sooner than others i think my time is now and i burned the bodies to the ground i saw faces turned to ash and i remember these faces baby because it s the last thing you ll ever see too bad it s not as good looking as you like i m already dead and i think i ll take you i ll take you with me,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
"I’ve been reflecting lately, and I just feel really grateful for everything and everyone that I have in my life.",i m grateful that now i can see that i am a part of everything and everything is a part of me you ve amazed me,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"The song lyrics chosen align very well with the user's emotional state of gratitude, as the lyrics explicitly express gratitude and a sense of unity with everything, which reflects a deep appreciation for life and connections. This earns a high score in emotional alignment. The context of gratitude is also well-matched, though the lyrics are somewhat broad and could potentially fit a variety of reflective or appreciative contexts, hence a slightly lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat fragmented and lack a clear narrative flow, which might make them less impactful or slightly confusing without additional context or melody."
"Someone very important to me is gone, and no matter how much time passes, I still feel the weight of that loss.",i ve been so long without you i try not to think about you but i do i know that i m to blame i got no right to call your name but i do i do i m so hurt to think that you d lie to me i m hurt way down deep inside of me,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics reflect a strong sense of loss and longing, aligning well with the user's emotional state of missing someone important who is no longer present. The mention of being hurt and the repeated admissions of missing the person ('but I do') resonate with the emotional weight described in the prompt. However, the song also introduces elements of betrayal or deceit ('to think that you'd lie to me'), which might not perfectly align with the user's context if their loss was not under similar circumstances. The lyrics are coherent and express a clear emotional narrative, though they might slightly deviate contextually from the user's specific situation of loss without associated deceit."

The context of transformation and newfound happiness in the song matches the user's feeling of a positive shift in life, earning a 4 for contextual relevance. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat repetitive and lacks varied structure, which might affect the depth of the message, resulting in a score of 3. Overall, the song is a good match for the user's emotional and contextual prompt, leading to an overall score of 4."
There’s someone I can’t stop thinking about lately. I think I’m in love with them.,she was always was talking about these crazy things that i never understood i uh word she said i all i understand that she was the girl i sat up at night thinking about in love in love in love in love in love so that s that s what i think is love when i m better cause she s here,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics chosen reflect a strong emotional alignment with the user's feelings of being in love and constantly thinking about someone, scoring a 4 in emotional alignment. The context of the song, which revolves around thoughts and feelings towards a significant other, is somewhat relevant to the user's situation of being in love, thus scoring a 3 in contextual relevance. However, the lyrical coherence of the song is somewhat low, scoring a 2, due to the disjointed and somewhat confusing structure of the lyrics, which may hinder the full expression and relatability of the intended emotions."
I stood in front of a huge and wasn't able to blurt out a single sentence. My knees were shaking the whole time.,this one brought me down to my knees i had to hold onto the wall my knees shaking quivering my head feels like a frisbee,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics align well with the emotional aspect of the user's prompt, capturing the physical sensation of weakness and nervousness ('knees shaking', 'had to hold onto the wall'). However, the context of the song isn't fully clear in relation to the user's experience of being unable to speak in front of a huge audience, as the song does not explicitly mention an audience or a similar situation. The lyrical coherence is somewhat low, as the lyrics are a bit disjointed and abstract ('head feels like a frisbee'), which might make it harder for the user to find a direct narrative or clear meaning in the song that relates to their specific experience."
I just know that tomorrow is going to be the best day ever,this is the first day of my life for once i m sure that this is where i long to be no need to know if there is something more than this no need to go cos there is nothing more than this my future is so clear cos everything s right here inside of me inside of me,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song's lyrics perfectly capture the emotion of anticipation and optimism about the future, aligning well with the user's feeling that 'tomorrow is going to be the best day ever.' The context of the song, which speaks about the beginning of a fulfilling phase of life, matches the theme of looking forward to a significant, positive day. The lyrics are mostly coherent and fluent, though the repetitive structure and lack of punctuation might slightly hinder the clarity. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's emotional and contextual needs."

However, the song's focus on personal disillusionment and the need for new inspiration only somewhat matches the user's proactive stance on fighting for their ideals. Contextually, the song's theme of seeking new role models or heroes is loosely relevant but does not directly address the user's intent to show their ideals to the world. The lyrics lack coherence, with repetitive and somewhat disjointed phrases that make it difficult to grasp a clear narrative or fluent message. This affects the overall effectiveness of the song in addressing the user's specific emotional and contextual needs."
"After going over the situation again, something finally clicked for me. I understand now what I didn’t see before.",i realised you saw right through this and you rise always i realised you re i realised you saw right through this and you rise always what made you right and didn t i free and didn t i solve and didn t i see what made you right and didn t i free and didn t i solve and didn t i see what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right ,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song lyrics partially align with the emotional aspect of the user's prompt, which involves a realization and understanding of a previously unclear situation. The repetition of phrases like 'I realised' and 'what made you right' suggests a moment of clarity or understanding, which matches the user's emotional state. However, the song's contextual relevance is lower because it lacks specificity and broader thematic content that directly relates to the user's situation of gaining a new understanding. The lyrical coherence is quite low due to repetitive and somewhat disjointed phrases that do not form a clear narrative or logical progression, making it difficult to grasp a solid meaning or story from the lyrics."

However, the emotional alignment is moderate (scored 3) as the lyrics focus more on the anticipation and experience of the show rather than the relaxation that follows. Contextually, the song is relevant to some extent (scored 2) as it involves music and social interaction, but it doesn't directly address the post-show relaxation. The lyrical coherence is somewhat weak (scored 2); the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative flow, which might make it harder for the user to find a direct connection with their emotional state."
"The more I think about it, the more I realize I made a terrible mistake. I really regret what I did.",i thought about sitting on the floor in second grade i couldn t keep the pace i thought i was the only one moving in slow motion while the other kids knew something i did not but if i acted like a clown i thought it d get me throughit did but that don t work no more you re not a kid no more i thought i d do some traveling never did regrets regrets i thought about the hours wasted watching tv drinking beer i thought about the things i thought about until immobilized with fear and all the great ideas i had and how we just made fun of those who had the guts to try and fail and then i ended up in jail regrets regrets in for a day seems the police had make a computer mistake said there must be thousands like me with the same name anyway i thought about the things i settled for or never tried i never visited my grandma even once when she was sick before she died so i don t blame you if you never come to see me here again regrets regrets1,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of regret and introspection, aligning well with the user's emotional state of realizing a past mistake and feeling remorseful. The context of reflecting on past actions and missed opportunities also matches the user's prompt about regretting past actions. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, though the narrative jumps between different regrets and scenarios, which can make the flow a bit disjointed. Overall, the song captures the essence of regret and missed opportunities, making it a good match for the user's emotional and contextual needs."

The raw expression of despair and the need for change resonate well with the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song scores a 3 as it addresses mental and emotional struggles which align with the user's description of their feelings, though it leans more towards a narrative of personal crisis and recovery rather than just the feeling of sadness. The lyrical coherence is somewhat disjointed and chaotic, scoring a 2, which might reflect the turmoil in the lyrics but could also hinder the listener's full comprehension and connection with the song. Overall, the song could provide a relatable expression of distress and a desire for change, but might benefit from clearer and more structured lyrics to better support the user's emotional journey."
My family just told me something completely unexpected... I’m still trying to wrap my head around it.,sometimes life surprises because you d never expect it to be that dangerous disguises that you never expect to see some things never change nothing s going to change that some things you can t explain like why we re all embracing conventional wisdom in a world that s just so unconventional made you turn around but you never expected to see that that s what makes that sound that you never expect to hear they don t know they re wrong but you know that they never can see that that s what makes them strong that they know that we ll never see1,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song captures the emotional essence of surprise and unexpectedness, aligning well with the user's feelings of trying to comprehend a sudden revelation from their family. The lyrics discuss the theme of unexpected events and the inability to foresee or explain them, which is contextually relevant to the user's situation. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat lacking; the lyrics are a bit disjointed and repetitive, which might make it harder for the user to find a clear narrative or message that resonates deeply with their specific circumstances."
