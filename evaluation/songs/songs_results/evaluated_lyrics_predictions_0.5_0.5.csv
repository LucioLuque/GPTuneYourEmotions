Watching my teammate stay late to coach the interns after hours left me genuinely inspired.,they had been listening to our music and was inspired by what we did and just the fact that ya know big pun was covering it and getting at me to be in the video it made me feel good like a legend before my times they did that like nobody else could do that cause that was one of those classic records that was like if you touch it you gotta really know what you doing or you really mess up the ingredients and they touched it and really put they own ingredients on it to make it sound real smooth,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The recommended song lyrics discuss the inspiration derived from music and the respect for handling a classic record well, which only slightly aligns with the emotion of inspiration in the user's prompt. However, the context of the song, which focuses on music and legacy, does not closely match the user's context of teamwork and mentorship. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear, structured narrative, making them moderately difficult to follow. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."
That clip of a golden retriever chasing bubbles still has me giggling at my desk.,get back get back get back get back get back hey you why why i laugh ,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not align well with the emotional tone of the user's prompt, which is light-hearted and joyful, centered around a playful and amusing scene with a golden retriever. The lyrics provided are repetitive and lack a clear connection to joy, playfulness, or the specific scenario of a dog chasing bubbles. Additionally, the lyrics are disjointed and lack fluency, making it difficult to discern a coherent message or theme. Therefore, the song scores low on emotional alignment, contextual relevance, and lyrical coherence."
The courier dumped my brand-new keyboard in a puddle and walked off—I'm fuming.,i m a self searching man at least i thought i was in those days i m okay i spose but still i snort up loads of cocaine they say it s down to mistrust abandonment and self hate i stare em in the eye and cry to fuck em if it felt great i struggle in myself place a bubble built around my life and if i haven t been a part of nothing in my pounding mind then fuck it i ll just sit within a grin and pick another time and distance in to mix the gin and substance in my fucking life cuz nothing knows the love inside feel it but the valve is clocked pissing out the liquids by the thousands to the fountain pots and none of your umbrellas could resist the muddy pounding drops with every dripping tear and all the shouting in this house i ve locked so try breaking in and see how far your candle burns it s pitch black forever in this mountain of abandoned words mismatching tenants in a crowded vegetated patch staring at the rusty jerrycan again now take a match one simple weed smoking alcoholic tosser one little key opens out your options proper stomp on the beat talk shit and down a vodka stop living weak own a house and see the doctor until the flames collapse i m comforting the heat i know it takes a man to stab a drunkard to his feet but i m tired the crusade of facts has played a random help but who s brain is who s mate i can t be arsed to slap myself it s never my fault i ve come to terms on my denial it seems to be the only thing to serve my custom of a smile the grief beneath the sober thing that burns enough to comfort sid before i m rich and bubbling i m eating out the fucking bin so fuck the normal way with corners i m just walking straight fuck a spoon fuck a knife i m all about the fork to face i m walking round my awkward mates that weep outside this doorstep and force stress deep inside a portion of my boring head i was pulled out with forceps i didn t wanna leave the womb i didn t wanna see the truth i didn t wanna breathe cuz it s a disgusting mistrusting dustbin we sit fucked in lusting for drug fixes fixed lost in nothing ,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of anger and frustration due to a specific incident involving a courier and a keyboard. The song's themes of self-destruction, substance abuse, and deep personal turmoil diverge significantly from the user's situation. The lyrics are complex and somewhat chaotic, lacking coherence and clarity, which makes it difficult to draw a direct connection to the user's experience of a mishandled delivery. The song's intense and dark emotional tone does not match the specific, albeit intense, frustration described by the user."
The elevator keeps dinging on every floor even when nobody’s inside; it’s testing my patience.,i wake to feel it all like a drum inside my chest pulled the cable from the wall but the buzzing never rests now i gotta go and you re unimpressed my choices never small and you know i never rest but you always see me fall i can t stop it cause now we re losing light i can t stop it let s sleep on it another night hours passing losing light if you re wondering let s sleep on it another night what d you come here for dodging me like a swinging door i know what you re waiting for but your patience wore out fast i gotta go and i m unimpressed my choices never small and you know i never rest and you can t catch my fall,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
My colleague refactored the legacy code and now it runs twice as fast—exactly what we needed.,we have the technology we have the technology1,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,"The song's mention of 'technology' loosely connects to the context of coding and software improvement, which scores a 1 for contextual relevance. However, the emotional alignment scores a 2 as the song does not clearly reflect the specific emotions of achievement or satisfaction that might be felt in the user's scenario. The lyrical coherence scores a 0 due to the repetition and lack of clear, fluent content in the provided lyrics, making it difficult to grasp any substantial message or theme."
"Let me know the moment you get home so I can relax, please.",do you want me to go i ll drive home it s alright hold the thought so tightly it was just a passing thing come inside have a seat i ll be with you soon you don t seem to have feeling turn the lights off when you leave,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song partially aligns with the emotional aspect of the prompt, which expresses a sense of concern and anticipation for someone's safe return. The lyrics 'do you want me to go i ll drive home it s alright' somewhat reflect the theme of returning home, but the overall tone and context diverge significantly from the user's request for reassurance upon arrival. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative, making it difficult to fully grasp the coherence and thematic relevance to the user's emotional state of needing to know when someone is safely home to relax."

However, the song's content, which delves into nonsensical and child-like inquiries, does not effectively mirror the specific frustration or context of navigating a confusing website interface. The lyrics lack practical relevance to the user's situation regarding checkout buttons. Additionally, the coherence of the lyrics is low, as the questions and answers are whimsical and lack logical or thematic consistency, which could potentially increase the user's feeling of being lost rather than providing clarity or emotional support."
I can’t stop wondering what the northern lights look like in person.,friday night and i don t have a clue just in the crowds we re dreaming as we move i wonder who we are i wonder who we are tonight and i know that someone s following me my littered face on the street the loveliest season has taken you write my name in the leaves i wonder who we are i wonder who we are tonight,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song's emotional tone of curiosity and introspection partially aligns with the user's sense of wonder about the northern lights, which is why it scores a 2 in emotional alignment. However, the song does not specifically address the northern lights or any related imagery, leading to a low score of 1 in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat fragmented and abstract, which makes them moderately difficult to follow, resulting in a coherence score of 2. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's prompt about the northern lights, both in terms of specific content and clear lyrical expression."
It's only Tuesday and I'm already day-dreaming about sinking into a hammock by the sea in my weekend.,so here i go i ll dive right in break through the waves straight to the ocean floor and although my hands are shaking i lie perfectly still cause i m determined to let myself sink down and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again i could wave my arms and swim away but never reach the shore but for now i will lay face first in the sand with the wreckage from ships that lost their way and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again and although my hands are shaking i lie perfectly still cause i m determined to let myself sink down and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
Spent a week on that proposal and it didn’t even make the meeting agenda—ouch.,not submitted,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"As no song lyrics were submitted, it is impossible to evaluate the emotional alignment, contextual relevance, or lyrical coherence in relation to the user's prompt."
My teammate keeps blaring voice notes on speaker in the open office; I swear earbuds were invented for a reason.,maybe there are cartwheels in your mouth maybe your words will grow up to be a gymnasts maybe you have been kicking people with them by accident i know some people get a whole lot of rocking in the rocking chair and the ones who dont sometimes get rocks in their voice boxes and their voice boxes become slingshots maybe you think my heart looks like a baby squirrel but you absolutely missed when you told the class i have head lice cause i one hundred percent absolutely do not have head lice and even if i do it is a fact that head lice prefer clean heads over dirty ones so i am clean as a whistle on a tea pot my mother says it is totally fine if i blow off steam as long as i speak in an octave my kindness can still reach my kindness knows mermaids never ever miss their legs in the water cause there are better ways to move through the ocean than kicking so guess what if i ever have my own team i am picking everyone first even the worst kid and the kid with the stutter like a skipping record cause i know all of us are scratched even if you cant hear it when we speak my mother says most people have heartbeats that are knocking on doors that will never open and i know my heart is a broken freezer chest cause i can never keep anything frozen so no i am not always crying i am just thawing outside of the lines and even if i am always crying it is a fact that salt is the only reason everything floats so good in the dead sea and just cause no one ever passes notes to me doesnt mean i am not super duper in fact my super duper might be a buoy or a paper boat the next time your nose gets stuck up the river cause it is a fact that our hearts stop every for a milli second every time we sneeze and some peoples houses have too much dust some peoples fathers are like attics ive heard attics have monsters in their walls and shaky stares i think if i lived in a house with attic id nightmare a burglar in my safety chest and maybe id look for rest in the sticks and stones cause my mother says a person can only swallow so much punch before hes drunk on his own fist but the only drunk i ever knew was sleeping in the alley behind our church and jesus turned water into his wine so even god has his bad days but on your bad days couldnt you just say hey im having a bad day instead of telling me im stupid or poor or telling me i dress like a boy cause maybe i am a boy and a girl maybe my name is andrea andrew so what it is a fact that bumblebees have hair on their eyes and humans also should comb though everything they see like an anchorman is not a sailor like the clouds might be a pillow fight like my mother says every bird perched on a telephone wire will listen to the conversations running through its feet to decide the direction of its flight so i know every word we speak can make hurricanes in peoples weather veins or shine their shiny shine so maybe sometime you could sit beside me on the bus and i could say guess what it is a fact that manatees have vocal chords but do not have ears and beethoven made music even when he could no longer hear and i know every belt that has hit someones back is still a belt that was built to hold something up and it is fact that egyptians slept on pillows made of stone but its not hard for me to dream that maybe one day youll write me back like the day i wrote the lightening bug to say i smashed my mason jar and i threw away the lid i didnt want to take a chance that id grow up to be a war i want to be a belly dance or an accordion or a pogo stick or the fingerprints the mason left in the mortar between the bricks to prove that he was here that he built a roof over someones head to keep the storm from their faith my mother says thats why we all were born and i think shes right so write back soon sincerely yours 1,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The recommended song lyrics are abstract and poetic, focusing on personal expression and resilience against verbal attacks or misunderstandings. However, they do not align well with the user's prompt about frustration with a teammate's behavior in an office setting. The emotional alignment is low because the song deals more with personal identity and overcoming emotional hurt rather than irritation or frustration in a professional context. The contextual relevance is also low as the lyrics do not address workplace etiquette or the specific issue of using earbuds. The lyrical coherence scores slightly higher due to the creative and metaphorical use of language, though it may be difficult for some listeners to follow due to its abstract nature."
Opened the fridge and the sour-milk smell nearly knocked me over.,i woke up covered in sand it s not so ugly now i ve seen its face oh i can hear it breathing it bites my thumb i throw it at the wall i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm it didn t take too long only bout an hour in the coals we all sat down to eat it the meal was burnt i cut my gums on bone i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm and as blue as my back  i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm and the moon was the size of my hand,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The song lyrics have a surreal and somewhat disturbing imagery that might loosely connect to the discomfort implied in the user's prompt about the sour milk. However, the emotional alignment is weak as the song's chaotic and intense narrative doesn't directly reflect the simple disgust or surprise of encountering a bad smell. Contextually, the mention of 'coughed out milk' is the only direct link to the user's experience with the fridge, but it's embedded in a much more abstract and confusing scenario that doesn't align well with the everyday context of the prompt. The lyrical coherence is low, as the lyrics are disjointed and cryptic, making it difficult to extract a clear and fluent narrative or emotion."
"I started presenting, then realized the slide on screen was upside down—facepalm moment.",i tell you there are no big shots in reality y all we re all in the same boat dealing with the same issues same problems same stuff don t even buy it all the perpetration you know all this we don t have problems that s a lie that s a lie i know that the enemy is doing the same thing to me that he s doing to everybody else i just know now that the only way to get out is through confrontation see we always thought it was retreat you know run away and i m telling you you got to confront it this is a strange song because this song when this song was written this is when everything sort of stopped it was written a long time ago but it was right before god just snatched me out of everything and because i didn t understand initially it was written i d written it about the whole amadou diallo situation when it first happened and i went to the studio and i laid it down and it was like strong for the first day and then it just regressed everyday after that and i said what s going on what s happening and at the end of it there was a word that i used rebel and i guess was afraid it was such a hot time in the city at that point i was afraid that if i put the record out people would misunderstand what i meant by rebel and they d just take it to the streets so i was very intimidated and afraid and before i knew it a whole host of things happened everything stopped after that and the creativity stopped everything stopped that s when i realized i had to understand what i was talking about before i could tell somebody else what i was talking about and i had to be you know a living example it s real crazy because i don t know what the press is saying because i don t listen to the press too much but i know the view is that i m emotionally unstable which is reality like you aren t i m laughing because what i ve realized i ve become is one of those mad scientists who does the tests on themselves first you see to make sure that they work and that s when you know ok look i got something that works you know what i m saying i m not gonna give you something that i haven t tested for myself and you go through and you re learning by way of experience and you re making mistakes and you re getting up a friend of mine once said to me he said look if we weren t supposed to turn around why does a car have a steering wheel are we just supposed to crash into the wall no we re supposed to say listen i was going the wrong way reverse in this particular song now i realize that this song is about freedom you see we could look at one human being but it s about the spirit of freedom being taken out and how it s taken out in all of us the song is called i find it hard to say bear with me a little bit,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's prompt about a humorous and slightly embarrassing situation of presenting with an upside-down slide. The song's themes of confrontation, personal growth, and societal issues are far removed from the light-hearted, facepalm moment described. The lyrics are complex and somewhat disjointed, discussing various deep and personal experiences that do not relate to the simple, everyday mishap in the prompt. The coherence of the lyrics is also low, as they jump between different topics and thoughts without a clear, fluent narrative."

However, the song's primary theme of a spiritual journey on the 'J train' diverges significantly from the sports or event-going context implied in the prompt, resulting in a contextual relevance score of 2. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and metaphorical but maintain a moderate level of fluency and sense, earning a lyrical coherence score of 3. Overall, while the song captures the excitement, it does not closely match the specific context of attending a semifinal event."

Got home drenched from the rain and found a thermos of hot tea waiting on my desk—little gestures like that rescue a day.,but meanwhile downstairs i m setting up shop a little too proud to let the matter drop and i can hear you up there isn t it romantic you re huffing and puffing rearranging deck chairs on the titanic and i reach for a glass of cool water drawn from the rivers of babylon and meanwhile outside the stars have come out and the humid summer air pulls at the ring in my snout and you stand at your window looking down and i spread wide my arms jump if you want to jump jump if you want to the water s warm i know i know cause i ve been swimming blindly along through the rivers of babylon,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The recommended song lyrics do not align well with the user's emotional and contextual prompt. The user's prompt describes a comforting, warm scenario involving a thoughtful gesture that turned a dreary day around. The song lyrics, however, depict a scene of conflict and emotional turmoil, with references to 'setting up shop,' 'huffing and puffing,' and 'rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic,' which suggest distress and futility rather than comfort and warmth. The lyrics also include disjointed imagery such as 'the rivers of Babylon' and 'the ring in my snout,' which do not connect clearly with the user's experience of finding solace in a simple, kind act. The lyrical coherence is slightly better as the lyrics maintain a certain poetic flow, but they are still somewhat cryptic and hard to follow, reducing their overall clarity and impact in relation to the prompt."

The lyrics reflect a transition from 'high school drama' to more adult experiences, which is somewhat relevant to the context of graduating to a higher education level. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low due to the repetitive and disjointed nature of the lyrics, which may detract from the overall clarity and impact of the message."

The lyrics are abstract and do not directly address or reflect the feeling of confusion or unreadiness suggested by the user's comparison of their notes to 'hieroglyphs'. Contextually, the song does not relate to the specific scenario of preparing for an exam or the academic environment. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative or theme, making them difficult to follow, which results in a low coherence score. Overall, the song does not match well with the user's emotional and contextual needs."
The sky finally cleared after days of rain—feels like good things are coming.,i can see clearly now the rain has gone i can see all obstacles in my way gone are the dark clouds that had me blind it s going to be a bright bright sunshiny day it s going to be a bright bright sunshiny day i think i can make it now the pain has gone and all of the bad feelings have disappeared here is the rainbow i ve been praying for it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day look all around there s nothing but blue skies look straight ahead nothing but blue skies i think i can make it now the pain has gone and all of the bad feelings have disappeared i can see clearly now the rain has gone it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"The recommended song 'I Can See Clearly Now' by Johnny Nash aligns perfectly with the user's emotional state of optimism and relief following a period of rain. The lyrics directly mention the clearing of rain and the emergence of a 'bright, sunshiny day,' which mirrors the user's sentiment of good things coming after days of rain. The context of weather improvement and a positive outlook is directly addressed in the song, making it highly relevant. The lyrics are clear, repetitive for emphasis, and maintain a coherent theme throughout, enhancing the listener's emotional experience. Overall, the song is an excellent match for the user's described mood and situation."
Saw my app featured on the store’s front page—cheeks hurt from smiling.,i stopped off at the grocery store to pick up a few things and i was reaching for some cheerios when i heard someone say my name i knew exactly who it was my heart started to race i turned around my legs got weak when i saw her face there stood the girl that broke my heart just a year ago i thought that i was over her but little did i know that running into her like that would leave me in a total mess wishing that we never said goodbye and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she ran over and hugged my neck i didn t want her to let go she smiled and said i looked just like a kid with my box of cheerios we laughed and talked about old times which wasn t all that smart cause it just left me with an emptiness when she pushed away her cart and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she walked away looked back and smiled clean up on aisle five,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of joy and pride from seeing their app featured. The song's narrative focuses on a melancholic encounter with a past love in a grocery store, which contrasts sharply with the user's celebratory mood. Contextually, the song's setting and themes of heartbreak and nostalgia do not match the user's context of achievement and happiness. The lyrics themselves are coherent and tell a clear story, but they do not resonate with the user's described situation or feelings."
Spent half an hour cursing the remote control until I realised I was pointing it at the wrong TV box—light-bulb moment.,i know i can never make up my mind half the time im sick just tryna find a straight light and i thought i saw the light behind your glassy narrow eyes fall fell and the weight came crashing down half the year i spent trying to relieve myself and i thought your hands were warmth something to fix my freezing form but i soon realized again it was just poor circulation and i thought i saw the light behind your glassy narrow eyes but i soon found it to be brewin slowly inside of me,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the user's prompt, which describes a humorous and slightly frustrating situation followed by a moment of realization. The emotional tone of the song seems to be more about confusion, searching, and a personal emotional struggle, which only partially matches the 'light-bulb moment' but misses the lighter, humorous aspect of the user's experience. Contextually, the song does not fit well as it seems to delve into deeper emotional introspection rather than a simple, everyday mishap. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but can be seen as disjointed and abstract, making it difficult to follow a clear narrative or theme."
The vet said the tests are normal—I can finally breathe again.,finally i feel calm anxiety disappeared there s no pain at all finally it went away there is no regret i know i understand i can breathe a sigh of relief i accept the end of my closed reality i need a sky innocent sky i feel like i left my shell behind the room full of light is tidied up i drew back the curtains and removed all my doubts i need a sky my moonlight and my sunset drawn with a trusting childlike smile,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The song's lyrics strongly align with the user's emotional state of relief and calmness after receiving good news from the vet, scoring high in emotional alignment. The context of the song, which speaks about overcoming anxiety and embracing a new reality, is somewhat relevant to the user's situation of relief after worry, thus scoring well in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat poetic and metaphorical, which might slightly obscure their direct meaning but still maintain a good sense of fluency and coherence."
"I laughed at his idea during the meeting, and guilt’s eating at me now.",i keep on laughing and you re keeping track and tonight i ll go back to the place i first knew that i d wait for you always on streets and in doorways where engines they die near the northeastern line and you mentioned a record that reminded me of a week that you couldn t get things out of your head i m truly sorry i missed that night it could have been the best time but it s just timing she showed up unexpected and i the train into town i put my collar down and pushed through the door but if it s smiles you want talk to the kid with the boy eyes and wake up dreaming next to him,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of regret and missed opportunities, which aligns somewhat with the user's feeling of guilt. However, the song's primary focus on past events and missed connections does not directly address the user's specific situation of feeling guilty about laughing at someone's idea. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and difficult to follow, reducing their coherence and overall relevance to the user's prompt. The overall score reflects a moderate alignment with the user's emotions but a low contextual relevance and coherence."

The context of missing someone in the morning aligns well with the user's scenario of feeling a void at a usual meeting place, hence a high score in contextual relevance. The lyrics, while expressive and poignant, are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, which affects the fluency and overall coherence, leading to a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
Walked into the living room and everyone yelled “welcome back!”—did not see that coming.,i didn t know you were there until you said hello you had been watching me for i don t know how long i hit my head against the lamp as by surprise i stood up don t be afraid you said it s only me the door wasn t locked the voice i d heard in the hall was hard to recognize but now we know he s on board wearing our disguise if only you and i could trust each other through this then together we could work out who the enemy is,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song captures a sense of surprise and unexpectedness, which aligns somewhat with the emotion of the user's prompt where they were surprised by a welcome back greeting. However, the song's theme of suspicion and mistrust diverges significantly from the presumably positive and warm context of the user's experience. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, telling a story of unexpected encounters and hidden identities, but they do not clearly connect to the simple, joyful scenario described in the prompt. Overall, the song's atmosphere of intrigue and caution does not match well with the cheerful surprise of being welcomed back."
Seeing my younger cousin nail her first piano solo blew me away.,paroles de la chanson hello darling oh boy now who s that girl over there i really got to talk to that chick cause that is my poor sugar candy girl hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking once in the usa i was out walking with a young girl i will seeking i see a young girl she started smiling i walked over we started talking i said hi baby she said how are you keeping i said i m cool i m just doing my own thing she said hey man i m here you are there enting you re tippa irie from that sexy sound system i said babe this is my first signment falling she said how about we just make it interesting i said there s one thing i wanna do my darling we can go home and have a quiet evening and have a mean you know that s very simple thinking and sparkling champagne that s what we ll be drinking but in the next verse i ll carry on explaining but right now i want boy and girl to sing hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking she s asleep she s asleep she s asleep she s asleep hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking now this girl i met her name was cathryn she had an old place in downtown brooklyn shall we take a cab or do you fancy walking she said just cool my car s just round the next turning oh when she said that i started smiling i m gonna find that girl when i feel shakeling jump in the car and then we started driving before i knew it outside her place we were parking inside her flat it was her first dating to be quite honest it was surely amazing i put my feet up and started relaxing after a while you know i started thinking what does this girl do for a living she said tippa man i don t do nothing i was left a million dollars by my own cook marvin so i jumped up at the sheer blue we were kissing and said a thing hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking hello darling hello good looking,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
My cat tried to pounce on its own shadow and face-planted into the rug; still chuckling.,once i laughed when i heard your saying that i d be playing solitaire uneasy in my easy chair it never entered my mind once you told me i was mistaken that i d awaken with the sun and ordered orange juice for one it never entered my mind you have what i laughed myself now i even have to scratch my back myself once you warned me that if you scorned me i d singing the maiden s prayer again and wish that you were there again to get into my hair again it never entered my mind it never entered my mind,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics primarily focus on themes of loneliness and regret, which do not align well with the light-hearted and amusing scenario described in the user's prompt about a cat's playful mishap. The emotional alignment is low because the song's somber tone contrasts sharply with the user's amusement. Contextually, the song does not relate to pets, playful accidents, or humor, resulting in a very poor fit. The lyrical coherence is moderate as the lyrics themselves are somewhat fluent and make sense within their own context, but they do not connect well with the user's described situation."
The airline lost my bag for the third time this year and acted like it wasn't a big deal.,so many took me for granted double crossed me for the bag when it landed i m thinkin you not the only fucking plug on this planet i m patient unfamiliar aircraft in sight,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.5,"The song's emotional alignment with the user's frustration over lost luggage is minimal, as it primarily discusses betrayal and mistrust rather than the specific annoyance and inconvenience of losing luggage. Contextually, the mention of an 'unfamiliar aircraft' loosely connects to the theme of air travel, but it does not directly address the issue of lost luggage or the airline's dismissive attitude. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, but they jump between ideas of betrayal, business dealings, and a sighting of an aircraft, which may confuse the listener without further context or connection to the central theme of luggage loss."

The repetitive mention of the dripping tap and its implications metaphorically and literally fits well with the user's focus on this specific and persistent sound. Emotionally, the song captures a sense of frustration and helplessness which resonates with the user's inability to focus due to the dripping tap, thus scoring high. However, the lyrical coherence of the song is lower as the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear, fluent narrative, making it challenging to follow a cohesive story or message beyond the central theme of the dripping tap."
My roommate finally started rinsing the dishes instead of piling them up—honestly proud of that progress.,yo listen i met this girl on baltic ave you can tell how she steps on boardwalk she was from park place i asked what she was doing on this side of town she said she had some taxes to pay i figured i d take a chance and advance to go and find out more about her cause there s more to know than the ways she sways and the way that she wears her clothes or the way that she plays this game so cold she said she came up rough and the one income household was not enough there d be nights she d go to sleep cold and hungry cause her mom was always short on food and money see people used to joke a lot and tease her bout her clothes not being in style dressed in dingy skirts and dirty sneakers from the finest second hand down on oriental ave but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she s got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly once she graduated jr high she started working overtime scrubbing floors or working on assembly lines just so she could help her mother out and after college they moved into marvin s garden and she got a job working at the city water department to save enough cash to move into community chest condos on pennsylvania ave she fell in love with this dude name ray who was a small time hustler from st charles place and he was known for always being in and out of trouble but the problem was that he was never on her level she argued with her mom about ray s work till he got sent upstate on the same say that she gave birth but see the baby never made it it drove her nearly crazy and she couldn t take it  but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she s got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly listen see where she came from many people find it hard just to hang on you often find them in the same place complaining instead of finding a better way of maintaining she could have balled up and cried and wished that she would die and just gave up on trying instead she grind from the bottom just to make it to the bottom now she s on top and she s flying but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly womanopoly yeah she s got it whoa yeah alright ,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song tells a story of struggle, perseverance, and eventual success, which aligns emotionally with the theme of overcoming challenges and making progress, as mentioned in the user's prompt about their roommate improving habits. However, the context of the song, which involves significant life struggles and societal issues, is much more intense and complex compared to the simple domestic improvement described in the prompt, leading to a low score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear narrative, but the complex story and the specific references to places and situations might make it less relatable directly to the user's situation."
Spent half the night checking on my pup’s fever; I’m dead tired but can’t leave his side.,you know i m tired i got a fevered brow you know i d change if i were with her now you gave me drugs you said d cure my ills they may cure yours but mine are with me still if i were with her now if i were with her now if i were with her now,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.67,"The song moderately aligns with the user's emotional state of being 'tired' and mentions a 'fevered brow,' which loosely connects to the user's situation of dealing with a fever (albeit the user's dog's fever, not their own). However, the song's context diverges as it seems to focus more on a personal emotional struggle and longing for another person, rather than the caregiving and concern for a pet as expressed in the prompt. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and focus on a specific scenario that doesn't fully match the user's experience, thus the contextual relevance is lower. The lyrical coherence is average; the lyrics make sense within their own narrative but might be seen as slightly disjointed or lacking a clear progression."
The app keeps saying ‘unknown error’ and I have no clue what’s actually wrong; my brain’s spinning.,there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake i waited in the rain for hours and you were late now it s not like me to say the right thing but you could ve called to let me know i checked your number twice don t understand it so i went home well i d been waiting for this weekend i thought that maybe we could see a show never dreamed i d have this feeling oh but seeing you is believing that s why i don t know why you didn t show up that night oh there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake i was waiting in the rain for hours and you were late since then i ve been running around trying to find you i went to the places that we always go i rang your home but got no answer so i jumped in my car i went round again i still don t believe it he was just leaving oh there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake yeah oh there must be oh there must be oh oh misunderstanding oh there must be there must be oh oh misunderstanding oh there must be there must be oh oh misunderstanding oh there must be there must be oh oh misunderstanding,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song 'Misunderstanding' by Genesis captures the frustration and confusion expressed in the user's prompt about an 'unknown error' and their inability to understand what's wrong. The emotional alignment is strong as the song conveys feelings of frustration and confusion due to a misunderstanding, similar to the user's feelings about the app error. Contextually, the song relates to waiting and not receiving expected communication, which parallels the user's experience of not understanding the error message. However, the song's primary context of a personal relationship mismatch slightly with the technical nature of the user's issue. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are repetitive and focus heavily on the theme of misunderstanding, but they are clear and convey the intended message effectively."
Saw a clip of glowing plankton beaches and now I’m itching to know everything about them.,i am the sand stuck under miles of rock watching the dry air sweep away my thoughts as we travel protected by shards of glass driving through the history of a million memories in a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls in a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls in a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls climbing a thousand unclimbed trees i don t know i want to know how it would feel to be on top of one of these i am the root quickly ascending up through the surrounding dirt quickly devoured by a hungry sun quickly devoured by a hungry son who is my father and we are alike we look alike we talk alike we are alike we are alike we are alike we look alike we talk alike thats why im hungry like the bellowing sky this is no lie as sure as light entering eye want to stay high everything s cool too cool so cool and i remember that everything falls so i take a look around me now as i speak and i imagine a disinterested crowd talking aloud and i think of what i want most and the crowd disappears and a fixated gaze envelopes my wondering mind and then she recruits and takes me to this place i ve been there before and that s where i saw her face in a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls in a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls in a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls climbing a thousand unclimbed trees i don t know i want to know how it would feel to be on top of one of these ,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the user's emotional state or contextual interest in glowing plankton beaches. The emotional alignment scores low as the lyrics evoke a sense of introspection and existential contemplation, which does not match the user's curiosity and fascination about a natural phenomenon. Contextually, the song is irrelevant to the topic of glowing plankton or beaches, focusing instead on personal and philosophical musings. The lyrical coherence is slightly higher as the lyrics maintain a consistent theme of self-reflection and identity, though they are somewhat abstract and disjointed, making them difficult to follow. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's prompt in terms of emotion, context, or lyrical clarity."
All morning I’ve been day-dreaming about escaping to a quiet cabin in the woods—can almost smell the pine.,lions in the street and roaming dogs in heat rabid foaming a beast caged in the heart of a city the body of his mother rotting in the summer ground he fled the town he went down south and crossed the border left chaos and disorder back there over his shoulder one morning he awoke in a green hotel with a strange creature groaning beside him sweat oozed from its shining skin is everybody in is everybody in is everybody in the ceremony is about to begin wake up you can t remember where it was had this dream stopped the snake was pale gold glazed and shrunken we were afraid to touch it the sheets were hot dead prisms and she was beside me old she s no young her dark red hair the white soft skin now run to the mirror in the bathroom look she s coming in here i can t live through each slow century of her moving i let my cheek slide down the cool smooth tile feel the good cold stinging blood the smooth hissing snakes of rain once i had a little game i liked to crawl back in my brain i think you know the game i mean i mean the game called go insane you should try this little game just close your eyes forget your name forget the world forget the people and we ll erect a different steeple this little game is fun to do just close your eyes no way to lose and i m right there i m going too release control we re breaking through way back deep into the brain back where there s never any pain and the rain falls gently on the town and over the heads of all of us and in the labyrinth of streams beneath the quiet unearthly presence of gentle hill dwellers in the gentle hills around reptiles abounding fossils caves cool air heights each house repeats a mold windows rolled beast car locked in against morning all now sleeping rugs silent mirrors vacant dust lying under the beds of lawful couples wound in sheets and daughters smug with semen eyes in their nipples wait there s been a slaughter here don t stop to speak or look around your gloves and fan are on the ground we re getting out of town we re going on the run and you re the one i want to come not to touch the earth not to see the sun nothing left to do but run run run let s run let s run house upon the hill moon is lying still shadows of the trees witnessing the wild breeze c mon baby run with me let s run run with me run with me run with me let s run the mansion is warm at the top of the hill rich are the rooms and the comforts there red are the arms of luxuriant chairs and you won t know a thing till you get inside dead president s corpse in the driver s car the engine runs on glue and tar c mon along we re not going very far to the east to meet the czar run with me run with me run with me let s run some outlaws lived by the side of the lake the minister s daughter s in love with the snake who lives in a well by the side of the road wake up girl we re almost home we should see the gates by mornin we should be inside by evening sun sun sun burn burn burn burn burn burn i will get you soon soon soon i am the lizard king i can do anything we came down the rivers and highways we came down from forests and falls we came down from carson and springfield we came down from phoenix enthralled and i can tell you the names of the kingdom i can tell you the things that you know listening for a fistful of silence climbing valleys into the shade for seven years i dwelt in the loose palace of exile playing strange games with the girls of the island now i have come again to the land of the fair and the strong and the wise brothers and sisters of the pale forest children of night who among you will run with the hunt now night arrives with her purple legion retire now to your tents and to your dreams tomorrow we enter the town of my birth i want to be ready3,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not align with the user's emotional and contextual prompt of day-dreaming about a peaceful escape to a cabin in the woods. The lyrics are chaotic, featuring intense and unsettling imagery such as 'lions in the street,' 'rabid foaming beasts,' and 'the body of his mother rotting.' These elements starkly contrast with the serene and tranquil imagery the user desires. The lyrics are also difficult to follow, lacking a clear narrative or coherence, which makes it challenging to extract a consistent theme or story. Overall, the song does not meet the user's needs for a calming and nature-centric theme."
"Practised for weeks, but the open-mic night was cancelled at the last minute—total letdown.",one night only is not enough,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's lyrics 'one night only is not enough' somewhat align with the user's emotion of disappointment, as it reflects a desire for more than what was available, similar to the user's thwarted expectation of performing. However, the song does not specifically address the context of preparation and cancellation, focusing instead on a general longing for more time, which only tangentially relates to the user's situation. The lyrics themselves are simple and coherent, but without additional context, they are quite limited in expressing a full narrative or deeper emotional complexity."
Can’t stand how people leave popcorn and cups all over the cinema floor after a movie; it really bothers me.,it took you long not to see it took me on not too see you next to me cause you re too hard to read just took a hit of ecstasy the room is spinning all around me but you re still next to to me so why else could you want to leave you said you needed to get going so you came home with me we made a bit of light love we figured we d figure it out in the morning so we ate breakfast early walking out the door is so dishonourable and sleeping on the floor is so fucking uncomfortable and a few months passed by we ran into each other at the movies and avoided eye contact you got some popcorn i got myself a berry smoothie and we entered separately but then when i sat down you were sitting right beside me and i couldn t concentrate so i said a little hey love and you continued to ignore me so i just watched the movie piranha in 3d disappointed me you re sleeping on my arm i ll cut off my numb arm but i don t have a knife so i ll gnaw off my numb arm you re sleeping on my arm i ll saw off my numb arm how did we get here these are my drunk eyes,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The emotional alignment of the song with the user's prompt is somewhat present as it touches on the discomfort and annoyance in a cinema setting, particularly with the mention of popcorn and a movie. However, the primary emotion in the song seems to revolve around a troubled relationship and personal distress, which doesn't directly reflect the user's frustration about the mess left in cinemas. Contextually, the song mentions a cinema setting briefly, but it primarily focuses on a personal narrative that doesn't align closely with the user's concern about cleanliness and etiquette. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and erratic, reflecting the chaotic emotions of the speaker but making it harder to follow a clear narrative or message."
Stepped into the elevator and the stench of stale sweat hit me so hard it made my stomach flip.,every day i wake up feeling this way i take it downtown with all the action going down i strike a match strike a match cook it up i m feeling so sick i feel so fucking sick on the bathroom floor gotta get out and get right hustling little girls cheating little boys yeah gotta get out gotta get out and get right gotta get out i gotta get out no more no more no more my eternal fire i m feeling so sick on the bathroom floor i m feeling so sick no more yeah i m feeling so sick i feel so sick no no more ,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics describe a feeling of sickness and discomfort, which aligns to a small extent with the user's experience of discomfort in the elevator. However, the context of the song, which seems to involve more intense and possibly self-destructive behaviors, does not match the simple, albeit unpleasant, scenario of encountering a bad smell in an elevator. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and disjointed, which affects their coherence but does reflect a chaotic or distressed state of mind. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual prompt."
I called the new boss ‘mom’ during the video call and wanted to crawl under my desk.,mama asked me where i went and i said i went away she asked me why i left and i told her i can t stay there s debts i gotta pay i might come back some day hopped in the back of the 95 chevy and drove it to the coast mom asked me if i got a job and i told her that i sell asked if she needed a few bucks at home and she told me go to hell and i think i might as well till then i ll surf the swell hopped in the back of the 95 chevy and drove it to the coast,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the user's emotional state of embarrassment and desire to hide after mistakenly calling their boss 'mom'. The song discusses leaving home, dealing with personal issues, and a strained relationship with a mother, which does not reflect the user's situation of a workplace mishap. The emotional alignment is low because the song's themes of escape and conflict do not match the user's feelings of embarrassment. Contextually, the song is also not relevant as it deals with personal journeys and family dynamics rather than professional environments or social faux pas. The lyrical coherence is moderate as the lyrics are somewhat clear but lack a strong narrative flow or connection between the verses. Overall, the song does not effectively address the user's emotional or contextual needs."

However, the song primarily discusses a spiritual journey ('J train' symbolizing a journey with Jesus), which does not directly relate to the excitement of attending a significant sports or competitive event, leading to a lower contextual relevance score. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and focus heavily on the metaphor of a train, which might confuse listeners who expect a direct connection to the user's situation, thus receiving a lower score in lyrical coherence."
Walking past that abandoned lot at night makes my pulse race.,and 6 am in morningside the first car rushes by we walk down to the garden and the sunlight fills your eyes and stops me for a moment till i turn and look the other way the windows are all open and it s saturday and where i ride the evening turns to blue and fades away a silence hangs enchanted through sunset and the lane the air is charged with sunlight and your name is ringing through my mind cathedral bells and sunlit is the night,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.5,"The recommended song lyrics primarily depict serene and peaceful imagery, focusing on moments like a morning walk in a garden, sunlight, and a tranquil evening. This contrasts sharply with the user's prompt, which conveys a sense of anxiety and fear associated with walking past an abandoned lot at night. Therefore, the emotional alignment is low. The context of the song, which seems to revolve around peaceful daily moments and possibly romantic undertones, does not match the eerie or suspenseful atmosphere suggested by the user's prompt, resulting in low contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves, while somewhat poetic, are a bit disjointed and lack a clear narrative, leading to a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
A stranger held the door while I juggled coffee and my laptop—brightened my morning.,well i woke up this morning i had something on my face it was still there when i brushed my teeth still there when i shaved i showed it to my neighbor and he broke into a grin i gave it away i gave it away smiles don t cost money give it away give it away maybe all you have is just a kind word you can say give it away give it away i woke up this morning with a song in my heart i hummed it all through coffee and it gave my day a start i took my song to work with me and i sang it for my friend don t think people do not care i know they care a lot don t be bashful of somebody give it all you ve got ,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics align well with the emotion of the user's prompt, which is a sense of joy and light-heartedness derived from a small act of kindness. The lyrics emphasize the impact of simple gestures, like a smile or a kind word, on brightening one's day, similar to the stranger's act of holding the door. Contextually, the song fits the theme of everyday kindness and its positive effects, although it doesn't specifically mention the scenario of juggling coffee and a laptop. The lyrics are coherent and fluently convey the message of spreading joy through small actions. However, the song's broader focus on general kindness and positivity slightly dilutes the specific contextual relevance of the prompt."
Scrolled past an old voicemail from her and suddenly the room felt empty.,the buzzing of the house has disappeared the glow is dimmed and contact s lost voices faces who were here the corner of the room was on and nothing else was needed no one else required nothing happens now it s all gone quiet for all intents for all our trust what was ever true the daily grind it sprang to life watching what was on instead of watching out the hours and hours and time to change i realise i m one of all the same but when i see you soon remind me how you lit up every room you knew that you were needed you talked and never tired how does it feel now that you ve been retired ,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of emptiness and loss, aligning well with the emotional prompt of feeling the absence of someone significant, as indicated by the old voicemail. The theme of an empty room and the silence that follows the absence of a once vibrant presence matches the contextual prompt effectively. The lyrics, however, are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative flow, which affects their coherence. The imagery of a once lively environment now quiet and the mention of being 'retired' metaphorically captures the essence of someone no longer being part of daily life, resonating with the user's emotional state."
My balcony tomatoes finally turned bright yellow today—couldn’t stop smiling.,and how i know i m happy now i jump right down the shoots of time and yes the weather was not always grey but the furrow always grazed my brow mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm now i m overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light yes we had some hard work but now it s right overcome with light overcome and my worries then were not grand but i felt them like a hammer pounding like i really feel feel them now and in a pinch i know i m dreaming mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm now i m overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light yes we had some scrapes but now it s right overcome with light overcome overcome with light overcome with light overcome,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of happiness and overcoming challenges, which aligns well with the user's emotion of joy upon seeing their tomatoes turn bright yellow. The repeated phrases 'overcome with light' and expressions of past hardships turning into something positive resonate with feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction, similar to the user's experience. However, the song's context about overcoming broader life challenges and the weather metaphor do not directly relate to gardening or the specific scenario of growing tomatoes, which affects its contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and abstract but maintain a decent level of fluency and coherence, making them understandable and emotionally impactful."
He doodled a silly sketch of us on the fridge; totally melted my heart.,you looked liked pingu in the igloo your nose was cold you showed me the icicle that you found hanging from the roof i remember your entrance to the room i was in and the half pint glass you were holding that made you look bigger than you were you drew a charming stick man on my left hand and you told me not to wash it off we loved you we loved you,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song captures a tender and affectionate emotion, similar to the user's prompt about a heartwarming sketch. The mention of drawing on the hand aligns with the doodling theme, although it's not directly about a fridge sketch. The lyrics are somewhat poetic and maintain a good flow, though they jump between scenes which might affect their direct relevance to the specific context of the user's prompt. Overall, the song resonates well with the emotional tone and somewhat with the context, but could be more directly aligned with the exact scenario described."
Waiting outside the dentist’s room; my knee won’t stop bouncing.,bad blood saturating the sheets and the blankets good god there are ghosts floating up from the pavement they flip over the houses blood runs out from the basements in its unholy flow you remember this whimpering thick nauseous feeling from your step brother chasing you around with a staple gun when you were young it was fun and then suddenly pain became a very real thing do you remember that feeling similarly this isnt fiction well actually mostly it is or a series of irl moments cloaked in the vagueness that songs give but when theres nothing to say and youve got to say something fuck i dont even know we pass on the street and say hi cause we have to even though both of us are clearly just like i fucking hate you so stilted and silent not awkward just angry hey i gotta go but ill see you at the show its that song everybody loves but the are garbage and it stresses me out how often youre mentioned its like everyone we know collectively vomited up a pile of brown sweaters or something and were so impressed with the results that they put them on the wall and im so sad youre in my head and im so sorry its so venomous especially because weve got like maybe four or five words ever spoken between us but i cant heave my heart into my mouth i cant tell you i cant stop you i dont want to this first day of school shit just seems to keep happening everybody says man its so cool were so glad youre doing your own thing but worse than disdain is colossal indifference the smiles are so big and theres no one at the gig im either deep in the woods or on tv for everyone and i know its disgusting how much i think about myself in relation to nothing the things that arent gonna stay just arent gonna stay like i was getting a tooth pulled in the free clinic in portland in 2007 the dentist turned out to be this dude a drummer whose band id recorded and somehow that was comforting then the novocaine block kicked in it closed up my throat and i was ready to go home maybe once this record comes out then i can stop drinking that might look good on a press release or something if they even still do those wait im certain they still do those and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics are chaotic and filled with a mix of intense emotions and disjointed narratives, which does not align well with the user's simple and specific emotional state of nervous anticipation while waiting outside a dentist's room. The mention of a dentist and a dental procedure within the lyrics provides a slight contextual relevance, but it is buried within a broader, unrelated narrative that does not focus on the user's current situation. The lyrics themselves are not very coherent, with a stream-of-consciousness style that jumps between various thoughts and scenarios, making it difficult to follow or find a clear message. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."

The emotional alignment scores a 3 as it reflects the mixed feelings of disappointment and optimism. Contextually, the song is more about balancing work and social life rather than specifically about job interviews or career progression, thus it scores a 2. The lyrics are repetitive but maintain a clear narrative about the struggle between career and personal life, earning a coherence score of 3. Overall, while the song touches on relevant themes of perseverance and missed opportunities, it doesn't perfectly match the specific context of job interviews and future optimism."
Ran my first 5 k without stopping; pretty pleased with myself.,tried to call you n got the answer phone now i m glad i m free to spend a weekend on my own do the shopping jog in the park and there s a lot of housework that needs to be done i m turning myself into a superhero of sorts and i m so happy now you didn t take my call this morning,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.33,"The song's emotional tone of independence and self-satisfaction aligns moderately well with the user's feeling of accomplishment from running their first 5k. However, the context of the song, which seems to focus more on enjoying a weekend alone and doing chores rather than celebrating a specific achievement like completing a run, only somewhat matches the user's situation. The lyrics lack a bit of fluency and are somewhat disjointed, affecting the overall coherence. The song captures a general sense of personal satisfaction but does not specifically celebrate the user's specific achievement of running a 5k."
"Realised the meeting invite said 7 a.m., not p.m.—no wonder no one joined.",i admit that i have realized i m not built for nine to fives but you know i m no good before noon so i ask myself why you decide to waste your time on a storefront s phone when you could have stayed at home sleeping in instead a choice to never leave the bed again we change the pace we count each other s debts there s forty minutes left in our day or should i say days you could have told me from the start i could have kept you safe from harm i could have left you alone you could have worked from home square one instead a choice to never leave your bed again2,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of frustration and realization about not fitting into a conventional schedule, which partially aligns with the user's emotion of surprise and perhaps frustration upon realizing the meeting time error. However, the song's broader theme of rejecting a nine-to-five lifestyle and the implications of personal choices in daily life only loosely connect to the specific context of a misread meeting time. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, lacking clear fluency and making it harder to grasp a coherent narrative or message directly relevant to the user's situation."
The lights flicked back on as soon as the storm ended—felt like exhaling.,alighted,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The provided song lyrics 'alighted' consist of only one word, which does not provide enough content to evaluate emotional alignment, contextual relevance, or lyrical coherence effectively. There is no clear connection to the user's prompt about the relief and change felt when a storm ends and the lights come back on. The single word does not form a coherent lyric or narrative, making it impossible to assess its relevance or emotional impact accurately."

Boxed up the holiday decorations; the living room looks strangely empty.,christmas time is here again it don t seem so different when last year which was filled with emptiness all around directionless,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of emptiness and a lack of direction, which aligns moderately well with the user's emotional state after removing holiday decorations, leaving the space feeling empty. The contextual relevance is strong as the lyrics specifically mention 'Christmas time,' directly relating to the user's activity of boxing up holiday decorations. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low due to the disjointed and fragmented nature of the lyrics, which might make it harder for the user to fully connect with the song's message."
Opened the fridge and found a note that read ‘road trip tomorrow!’—didn’t see that coming.,yesterday alone i laid everything out on the carpet books kitchen things objects with specific purpose or none arranged them sideways in a grid on the floor there unmoored out of context and then considered it first the whole picture then everything individually humming along at the deadest pace imaginable one object then another and then the next and i wondered what they meant there if they meant anything still found notes camping supplies a book you bought in the desert identifying wildflowers pictures from vacations from parties kitschy gifts we bought from rest stops on that road trip out west objects everything itself and then memory all of it laid out there from the dining room the living room the hallway and the basement and the kitchen from that room we called the office but never used even the bathroom everything laid out there on the floor on the carpet out of context and i sat there for hours today i moved everything from the floor to the table in the dining room placed each thing carefully without reason or at least without one i understood or could describe there on the table together and when i was done and stepped back i realized what i had made keepsakes pictures letters ordinary objects all collected there a memorial and i thought of ones on highways or set by gravestones all the things you see there but dont understand but still bring a remembered thing back vividly invoke someones reality when there together in that place in that way out of context and i knew i had to take it down before anybody else saw tomorrow i plan to put them all somewhere those things in boxes side of the road attic maybe all these things that push and pull me through history to places i once was places i mightve gone places i ended up going postcards ticket stubs from one thing or another a personalized coffee mug neither your name nor mine phone cards and old phones a page from an old calendar i bought once at a thrift store and insisted on hanging that cycles of the moon print photos old boots of mine put them in boxes and i sat there for hours in the living room first then in the dining room moving things around picking things up and seeing where they took me to what place in history what moment on our timeline where we were where i was where i thought wed end up in this house or on the highway driving somewhere near christmas in the desert or anywhere else and i put them in boxes6,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of unexpected reminiscence and preparation, which aligns somewhat with the emotional surprise and anticipation in the user's prompt about an unplanned road trip. The contextual relevance is strong as the lyrics mention road trips, keepsakes, and memories, which ties into the idea of sudden travel plans. However, the lyrical coherence is lower due to the stream-of-consciousness style that lacks clear structure and punctuation, making it somewhat difficult to follow. Overall, the song captures the essence of looking back and preparing for a journey, but its effectiveness is diminished by its complex lyrical presentation."
Watching my sister patiently guide my nephew through his first steps left me amazed by her dedication.,i was down in music city bout a week ago i wanted to see the brand old loper show so i held a cap and i headed down to opryland they said they sold their last ticket the day before so i kinda just hung around the backstage door and down the steps she came man oh man my favourite female country star she waved her fans and headed for her car her tire unlike her body was very flat she said could you change my tire i said your wish is my desire as she raised the lid i grabbed her bumper jack she said i sure do appreciate you changing my tire if i told you who it was if i told you who it was you d say i was making it up you ve seen her on the screen and in country magazines you d think i was making it up she said it was our little secret and by golly i m gonna keep it anyway you wouldn t believe it if i told you who it was she said you need a lift and i said well you can drop me of at the york motel so we headed down briley parkway in the town i told her i got all your records ma am she smiled and said well i be damned she said you re kind of cute fella wanna mess around when we got to my room just the people lied i said sure wish i could ve heard you sing tonight she smiled at me and said what do you wanna hear well if i was one of them country music folks i ll tell you she d sure get my vote for the best performance of the year if i told you who it was if i told you who it was you d say i was making it up you ve seen her on the screen and in country magazines you d think i was making it up she said it was our little secret and by golly i m gonna keep it anyway you wouldn t believe it if i told you who it was  well i tell you this much when i put my arms around her and squeezed her real tight she looked up at me with those big beautiful eyes took a deep breath and a sigh and said howdy i m just so proud to be here if i told you who it was if i told you who it was you d say i was making it up you ve seen her on the screen and in country magazines you d think i was making it up she said it was our little secret and by golly i m gonna keep it anyway you wouldn t believe it if i told you who it was,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
I just finished a comedy movie and found myself laughing out loud through the entire end credits.,on my own in the back thought of death made me laugh summer s sun a sinking hole we were young and passionate we were young,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of joy and amusement after watching a comedy movie. The lyrics mention thoughts of death and a sinking feeling, which contrasts sharply with the light-hearted and cheerful mood typically associated with comedies. Contextually, the song also misses the mark as it seems to reflect on youth and possibly loss, which does not connect with the scenario of enjoying a comedy. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear narrative or fluency, making them difficult to follow in a meaningful way."
"I just returned to my desk and found my meticulously organized files shredded and scattered everywhere, and I was absolutely furious.",got me fucked up,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics 'got me fucked up' do capture a general sense of frustration and anger, aligning somewhat with the user's emotional state of fury. However, the lyrics are extremely brief and lack depth, which limits their ability to fully convey the intensity and specifics of the situation described. Contextually, the lyrics are not specifically relevant to the scenario of finding one's files shredded, as they do not address this particular situation or anything similar. The coherence of the lyrics is low due to their brevity and lack of context or elaboration, making it difficult to derive a clear and fluent narrative or message from them alone."
The neighbor's car alarm blaring at sunrise grated on my nerves and ruined my morning.,i tried so hard to stay strong the first time i slept alone but the paint was ripped off my front door there was no one to open it though let s talk about it pull me into your darkness there s nothing left to give away nothing left to say today today but the paint got ripped off my front door the paint was ripped off my front door the paint was ripped off my front door,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics chosen do not align well with the user's emotional state or the context of the prompt. The user's prompt expresses frustration and irritation due to a disruptive noise early in the morning, whereas the song lyrics seem to focus on a personal emotional struggle related to loneliness and possibly a breakup, as indicated by references to sleeping alone and the imagery of a damaged front door. The emotional tone of the song is more about sadness and introspection rather than irritation or disturbance. Contextually, the song does not mention or relate to sounds, alarms, or morning disruptions, making it irrelevant to the situation described. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative, leading to a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
"After staying up all night finishing that report, hearing my manager praise my work in the morning convinced me i’d made the right call.",listen to the sound listen to the sound everything always works out,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics 'listen to the sound listen to the sound everything always works out' align well emotionally with the user's feeling of validation and relief after receiving praise for hard work. The emotional alignment is high as the lyrics reflect a sense of reassurance and positivity, similar to the user's experience. Contextually, the lyrics are somewhat relevant as they convey a general sense of things turning out well, which matches the user's outcome of their effort being acknowledged positively. However, the lyrics are quite general and do not specifically address the scenario of working hard on a report or the work environment, which slightly lowers the contextual relevance score. The lyrical coherence is good; the repetition emphasizes the message and the simplicity of the lyrics makes them easy to understand and relate to, though they lack depth and detail."
"My brother felt terrible all night, so I stayed by his side and made sure he had everything he needed.",well i spent all night alone with you and you weren t even there your eyes burned on me like the midnight sun and somewhere in the night i knew how much i really cared cause you re the one you re the one for me you are the one i tried to keep my distance afraid of striking out but protect myself from life is all i ve done so i got to tell you now before another night goes by that you re the one you re the one for me you are the one and sometimes it hits you right away and sometimes it takes awhile oh but now that you ve crept up on me there s nothing i can do to stay away from you though lord i ve tried to keep it down but resistance only moves it to the front so i got to tell you now and not worry what you ll say cause you re the one you re the one for me you are the one,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.5,"The emotional alignment of the song with the user's prompt is low. The song speaks about a romantic longing and realization of love, which does not align well with the user's experience of caring for a sick brother. The context of the song, focusing on romantic feelings, also does not match the user's situation of familial care and support. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, with a clear narrative about realizing and confessing love, which is why the coherence score is moderate. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs as described in the prompt."
Receiving an urgent call from my doctor asking me to come in immediately without any details left me completely uncertain about what was wrong.,i don t know why pain has filled me it s come right in and it has drilled me in a place that used to be so pure seems like i just walk a maze that keeps me in a useless daze a state of mind that keeps me quite unsure which way should i go i say when on my bed prostrate i lay dreams begin to lure and when i wake i look around the the search for lost and found runs out my eyes to see there is no cure where s the understanding where s the love where s the realization it must be some place above ,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics strongly resonate with the emotion of uncertainty and anxiety described in the user's prompt, as it discusses feelings of pain, confusion, and a lack of understanding, which aligns well with the emotional turmoil of receiving an unsettling call from a doctor. Contextually, the song fits to some extent as it deals with internal struggles and seeking answers, mirroring the user's situation of not knowing what the health issue might be. However, it doesn't specifically address medical or health-related anxieties, which slightly lowers its contextual relevance. The lyrics are coherent, maintaining a clear narrative about searching for clarity and dealing with emotional pain, though the flow and structure could be slightly more polished to enhance understanding."
I just uncovered a major secret hidden in the archives and can’t stop wondering what else I’ll find.,well i was ready to walk into your heart i ll make believe there s something i ve lost but i think you know what i ve done oh i think you know i ll be your surprise it s just a secret that s alwasy on display or just a memory you can t throw away oh i ll be your surprise,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The recommended song partially aligns with the user's emotional state of curiosity and intrigue about uncovering secrets, as reflected in the lyrics about secrets and surprises. However, the song's focus on personal relationships and emotional revelations doesn't perfectly match the context of discovering historical or archival secrets, which is more intellectually stimulating than emotionally charged. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative flow, making it difficult to fully grasp the coherence of the message, which affects the overall effectiveness of the song in addressing the user's specific situation."

The song's repeated references to 'loads of cheese' and 'seven figure swagger' do not connect with the culinary or emotional aspects of the user's prompt. The lyrics are repetitive and lack depth, contributing to a low coherence score. Overall, the song fails to match the user's context and emotional state, and the lyrics do not provide a coherent or relevant narrative."
"I opened the email to see that tonight’s concert had been canceled, leaving me utterly let down.",missed the saturday dance heard they crowded the floor i couldn t bear it without you don t get around much anymore went to visit the club i got as far as the door they d ve asked me about you don t get around much anymore well darling i guess my mind s more at ease but never the less why stir up memories i ve been invited on dates should have gone but what for it s awfully different without you don t get around much anymore,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song 'Don't Get Around Much Anymore' reflects a sense of disappointment and withdrawal from social activities, aligning well with the user's emotion of feeling let down by the concert cancellation. The lyrics about missing dances and not visiting clubs anymore are contextually relevant to the theme of a canceled concert. However, the coherence of the lyrics is slightly lower due to the somewhat disjointed and repetitive nature of the verses, which might not fully convey a clear narrative or emotional progression."
"I just found out the community center canceled the free cooking classes without telling me, and it felt unfair that they didn’t ask for my opinion.",i went to class you didn t show up i thought we said that we d keep in touch walk through town disassembled on a crutch just like we did when you were in love i left the house and i didn t miss much you opened your mouth and i lost my trust yeah i left the house for the first time in months for the first time in months now here i am disassembled as a whole when i got home i lost control,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"The song captures a sense of betrayal and loss of trust, which aligns with the user's feelings of unfairness and exclusion from decision-making. However, the context of the song, which seems to revolve around a personal relationship and emotional breakdown, does not perfectly align with the specific scenario of canceled community classes. The lyrics are coherent and convey a clear narrative of disappointment and emotional distress, but they do not directly address the community or group dynamics involved in the user's situation."
"I just took a bite of my sandwich and realized it had gone bad, making my stomach turn.",i realize i m hungry i recognize the pain in my gut i don t know where it comes from or what i m gonna do about it this little pain inside my tiny tummy souplantaion fosters freeze in n out or chuck e cheese burger king or taco bell all these restaurants sound so well that s what i m gonna do about it this little pain inside my tiny tummy hamburger helper on those days when i sit home and fucking laze and when my budget is kind of low there s only so many good places to go that s what i m gonna do about it this little pain inside my tiny tummy,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song lyrics focus on hunger and the pain associated with it, which partially aligns with the user's experience of discomfort from eating a bad sandwich. However, the song's emphasis on deciding where to eat next and listing various food outlets does not directly relate to the user's immediate negative experience with spoiled food. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack depth, reducing their coherence and overall relevance to the user's specific situation of feeling sick from a bad sandwich."
I just waved enthusiastically at someone who wasn’t waving at me and wanted to disappear on the spot.,last night i saw someone with your eyes someone with your smile someone with your smile we danced and though glad that she had asked me to she didnt have your arms,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song captures a sense of embarrassment and awkwardness, which aligns somewhat with the user's emotional state of wanting to disappear after a mistaken wave. However, the song primarily focuses on a romantic encounter with someone who resembles a past lover, which doesn't directly relate to the user's situation of social embarrassment. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, telling a clear story of dancing with someone who reminds the singer of another, but they do not directly address the user's feelings of wanting to vanish after a social mishap. Overall, the song does not strongly align with the user's emotional and contextual needs."
I just found out my best friend is flying in for a surprise visit and I can’t stop smiling.,i got a big surprise when i saw you smile i never dreamed that it could be but now i realize since i saw you smile there s only happiness for me so bye bye blues bye bye blues bells ring birds sing sun is shining no more pining just we two smiling thru don t sigh don t cry bye bye blues blues,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The song's lyrics perfectly capture the emotion of happiness and surprise, aligning well with the user's feeling of joy upon learning their best friend is visiting. The repeated mentions of smiling and happiness reflect the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song fits the theme of a joyful reunion, although it doesn't specifically mention a friend visiting, which slightly lowers the contextual score. The lyrics are coherent and flow well, with a cheerful tone that matches the user's mood, though some repetitive phrases slightly affect the lyrical coherence score."
"I just got word my friend is driving here through this raging thunderstorm, and each crack of thunder sent a chill down my spine.",i just looked in the mirror was that me i m older now than i used to be the sky above me lord it s turnin red there s a hard rain fallin round my head oh lord fallin round my head oh lord fallin round my head oh lord fallin round my head oh lord fallin round my head the road i m standin on it twists and turns the soles of my feet lord they re bout to burn the reaper beckons and he points the way oh lord i m gettin closer every day oh lord closer every day oh lord closer every day oh lord closer every day oh lord closer every day,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of foreboding and concern, aligning well with the user's emotional state of anxiety and worry due to the thunderstorm and their friend's safety. The mention of a 'hard rain fallin round my head' directly connects to the stormy context, though the song's broader themes of aging and existential reflection are less directly relevant. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and abstract, which might affect their coherence and direct applicability to the user's specific situation about their friend driving through a storm."
"I came home after a long day to find my partner had cleaned up and cooked dinner, and it made me realize how lucky I am to have them.",last night we brought the children by to visit their grandpa and it s plain to see they re truly part of him while we were there their grandma took out some old photographs man he sure looked a lot like me back then i m seein my father in me i guess that s how it s meant to be and i find i m more and more like him each day i notice i walk the way he walks i notice i talk the way he talks i m startin to see my father in me and today i took my wife for a walk down that old dirt road where my daddy took my mom so many times and we found the time to mention things we never had before and we shared some thoughts about the family life yeah i m seein my father in me i guess that s how it s meant to be and i find i m more and more like him each day i notice i walk the way he walks i notice i talk the way he talks i m startin to see my father in me and now lookin back i can recall the times we disagreed when i could not take hold of his old fashioned ways and the more i tried to prove him wrong the more i proved him right now i know why he still stood by me when i went through that stage i m seein my father in me i guess that s how it s meant to be and i find i m more and more like him each day i notice i walk the way he walks i notice i talk the way he talks i m startin to see my father in me and i m happy to see my father in me,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,"The song's lyrics primarily focus on the theme of familial resemblance and legacy, particularly between a father and son. This theme does not align well with the user's emotional experience of gratitude and appreciation for their partner's thoughtful actions. The emotional alignment and contextual relevance scores are low because the song does not reflect the specific emotional and situational context described by the user. However, the lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story about generational similarities, which is why the coherence score is higher. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's described situation and feelings."
"I just found my grandmother’s favorite shawl tucked in her chair, and tears welled up as I remembered her warmth.",there s a blanket of snow covering up the old road to the house where i was raised through the window i see the lights on the tree and a glow from the old fireplace though it all looks the same so much as changed from the way it used to be christmas memories of happy years gone by they come back to me and keep me warm inside still those memories make me cry now the stockings are filled the old house is still and the kids are all dreaming away there s that old easy chair me and daddy sat there waiting for santa s sleigh now daddy has gone but we ll carry on cause the little ones still need christmas memories of happy years gone by they come back to me and keep me warm inside still those christmas memories oh they mean so much to me oh those christmas memories make me cry,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong emotional alignment with the user's feelings of nostalgia and sadness, as they both deal with memories associated with items from the past and the warmth they provided. The context of the song, focusing on Christmas and family memories, is somewhat relevant but not directly aligned with the specific memory of the grandmother or her shawl. The lyrics are coherent and fluently convey the sentiment of cherishing past memories and the emotional impact they have, even though they center around a different family context."
"I opened my inbox this morning to find I’d received my scholarship award, and I can’t stop grinning from ear to ear.",i think i saw ol santa through my window christmas eve my eyes were really droopy but i really do believe it must ve been ol santa cause i saw his big red hat and i know my mom and dad can t fly like that oh no and then i heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door the same ol christmas trick my dad had played since i was four he stands outside my bedroom yelling ho ho ho because he knows i don t believe in santa claus no way i think my daddy sees me peeking from my door but he pretends he s santa anyway every year he tries to fool me but i m a big boy now i don t believe in santa or his sleigh no way so i went back to my bed and i curled up nice and tight i stared out of my window and i looked into the night and then all of a sudden through my window i could see santa claus was flying by and smiling at me santa claus santa claus it must ve been ol santa claus santa claus santa claus happy ho ho ho to you and then i heard ol rudolph tellin me to come outside he told me that ol santa wanted me to take a ride i climbed out of my window and i jumped onto his sleigh and then ol santa took me up and away  we flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below i saw my big red school house and the town square picture show it was really past my bedtime and so ol santa said little boys like you should be in bed so i hollered ho ho ho and i put on santa s hat then he let me hold the reins a while we pulled up to my window and i jumped back in my room and i waved goodbye to santa with a smile when i woke up christmas morning well it was clear and bright my parents said my window had blown open in the night i smiled as i told them that it must ve been the cat and they asked me where i got my big red hat yeah yeah c mon santa claus santa claus it must ve been ol santa claus santa claus santa claus happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you one more again,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song is a Christmas-themed narrative about a child's interaction with Santa Claus, which does not align with the user's prompt about receiving a scholarship award. The emotional alignment is very poor as the song's festive, child-like excitement and disbelief in Santa Claus does not reflect the user's joy and pride in receiving a scholarship. Contextually, the song is also irrelevant as it focuses on a holiday scenario rather than an achievement or academic-related theme. The lyrics themselves are coherent and tell a clear story, which is why the coherence score is moderate. Overall, the song does not match the user's emotional state or context, making it a poor recommendation for this particular situation."
"I woke up this morning to find a bouquet of flowers on my nightstand with a note that said ‘just because’, and my heart melted.",at this point in my life clearly i can see all the gifts he bestowed upon me that is why deep inside i have this joy there was once a time my soul was searching to find a place to nest now in this joy i can rest now my heart holds the love he has given me and that s all that i ll ever need to live believe and spread his love i m so glad i have this joy,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a deep sense of joy and gratitude, which aligns well with the user's emotional state of feeling touched and loved, as described in the prompt. This earns a high score for emotional alignment. However, the context of the song, which seems to focus on spiritual gratitude and personal transformation, does not perfectly match the romantic and somewhat spontaneous context of receiving flowers 'just because'. This results in a lower score for contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, but the flow and clarity could be improved for better understanding, leading to a moderate score in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song captures the emotion well but is less aligned with the specific romantic context and could benefit from clearer lyrics."
"I just sat down to record my podcast and realized I hadn’t rehearsed my opening lines, and I felt my palms grow clammy.",and i have grown i have could ve sworn i have for long i was certain that i saw it clear i am you then your sweaty palms surround it and i have grown i have could ve sworn i had but i forgot that i ever really was here heaving with all my might hear the lightning through the sky heaving with all my might hear the lightning through this for long i was certain that i saw it clear i am you than your sweaty palms surrounded but i forgot that i was ever really was here ,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,"The song lyrics mention 'sweaty palms,' which aligns somewhat with the user's feeling of nervousness as described in the prompt. However, the overall emotional tone and context of the song do not clearly match the specific scenario of preparing for a podcast and the associated anxiety. The lyrics are quite disjointed and lack fluency, making it difficult to discern a coherent message or theme that relates directly to the user's situation. Therefore, while there is a slight connection in terms of the mention of physical anxiety symptoms, the song does not effectively address the broader context or provide coherent lyrical content."
I just watched the sunrise break through the clouds and felt sure today would bring new opportunities.,there s no reason for you to lose your mind cause i ve seen something that s gonna change our time if i could i d make you understand if i could i d make you understand there s no hurry it s gonna come for sure cause i know that someday we re gonna end our war if i could i would now ,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song chosen aligns well with the emotional aspect of the user's prompt, which is a sense of optimism and anticipation for positive changes, reflected in the lyrics 'I've seen something that's gonna change our time' and 'it's gonna come for sure.' However, the contextual relevance is moderate as the song hints at overcoming a struggle or 'war,' which doesn't directly relate to the serene and hopeful context of watching a sunrise and expecting new opportunities. The lyrical coherence is average; the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and vague, which might make it harder for the listener to fully grasp or relate to the intended message without more context or elaboration."
I just saw my project showcased in the company newsletter and couldn’t help but beam at what I’d accomplished.,i woke about nine opened up my eyes figured it s time to rise threw the curtains open wide and peeped outside yo the weather was fine i knew that was a sign that today would be a good day i popped a cd on jumped in the shower sploshed and washed till i m fresh like a flower next grab a towel and i dry myself off i grab my vest cos next it s time to get dressed i rocked white socks my fubu boxers clean white jeans and this mean white top wot zips down the side of my neck to my left shoulder blade feel like i just got paid today yeah brushed my teeth and my hair then i popped my contacts in and binned the containers put on my trainers out the front door waves hi to the neighbours oh what a glorious thing waking up in the morning baby oh what a glorious thing get to have a whole day hey so i hop on my stolen bike and ride down the kingsland road bouncing over speed bumps calves pump pedals the way i ramp that plank i desrve a frigging medal petrol fumes looms as my bike zooms stuck behind a bus wot s rough so i cough which reminds me when the sun s blistering i m gonna have to take an anti histamine or else i ll get stressed again sneeze so hard i split my vest again vex my chest till i m depressed again no way pos sis so i drop by the office check out my emails females blowing up my inbox boom soon though i m off again headed down park hook up with my peeps we kick ball till its dark then we re off to rock a show and i m super glad it s stunners time kicking dope rhymes in the summertime word,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song captures a positive and upbeat mood, aligning well with the user's feeling of accomplishment and pride, hence a score of 4 for emotional alignment. However, the context of the song, which revolves around a typical day enjoying good weather, riding a bike, and hanging out with friends, only partially matches the user's context of professional achievement, resulting in a score of 2 for contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat coherent with a clear narrative flow, but the colloquial and casual language might detract from the professional context of the user's achievement, leading to a score of 3 for lyrical coherence. Overall, the song has a positive vibe that matches the user's emotions but doesn't fully encapsulate the professional achievement context."
"I just found an old photo of my childhood home tucked away in a drawer, and it made me realize how far I’ve come.",there s an old kodak camera in my dresser drawer i ran across it just this afternoon and i realized that i don t ever use it anymore in fact last time i did i think it was with you when we were down in cozumel we had the whole beach to ourselves and it s crazy now to think that it s all there on that film and i could take it to the store to be developed but what for i can still see everything just fine and who needs pictures with a memory like mine standing there i couldn t help but think about everything that might be on that roll i think it even has another trip we took i guess that must ve been at least three years ago when we were down in baton rouge and there wasn t much to do so we drove into new orleans every afternoon and i swear that you would think that it was only yesterday cause i can still see everything just fine who needs pictures with a memory like mine somewhere in my closet there s a cardboard box just sitting on a shelf it s full of faded memories and it s been there ever since the night you left oh just forgotten photographs to remind me of the past oh but i can still see everything just fine who needs pictures with a memory like mine yeah who needs pictures with a memory like mine,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,"The song 'Who Needs Pictures' by Brad Paisley aligns well with the user's emotional state of nostalgia and reflection upon finding an old photo of their childhood home. The lyrics discuss discovering old photographs and the realization that vivid memories don't necessarily need physical pictures, which resonates deeply with the user's experience of reminiscing about their past. The song is contextually relevant as it directly addresses the theme of old memories and photographs, perfectly fitting the scenario described by the user. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear, fluent story about past experiences and the power of memory, though some repetitive elements slightly affect the overall coherence. Overall, the song effectively captures the emotional and contextual essence of the user's prompt."
"I just got the call that my test results came back clear, and I felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders.",let me down now i m falling off the line and i can feel it crawling through my spine because in my room now i feel so divine not a worry running through my mind,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song lyrics chosen reflect a sense of relief and liberation, aligning well with the emotion of the user's prompt about feeling a weight lifted after receiving good news. The emotional alignment scores high as the lyrics express a transition from a tense to a more relaxed state, similar to the user's experience. However, the contextual relevance is moderate because the lyrics suggest a general sense of relief without specific reference to receiving good news like test results, which slightly deviates from the user's specific context. The lyrical coherence is average; the lyrics are somewhat fluent but could be clearer in conveying a specific message or story, making them slightly ambiguous in terms of their full meaning."
I just reread the harsh message I sent my friend last night and felt a deep regret for how I spoke.,well i m sorry that you lost your shit and that s all i ve got to say about it tonight i ve thought you told me you never screamed out loud and you re proud of porno queen yes proud oh got out of bed regan it s all in your little head,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
"I just sat down for dinner and saw my father’s chair still empty, my heart ached and I can’t stop crying.",from my body out my eyes leaving my insides like the bed of ache forgotten was the story was the language never to breathe again or so it seems the surface of the earth felt like a fable after she drank up all the sea bury my father out in a church yard i have no one left to remember my name,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics resonate strongly with the emotion of loss and grief, as reflected in the user's prompt about missing their father. The mention of burying a father aligns well with the user's emotional state, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the lyrics touch upon themes of loss and memory, which is relevant to the user's situation of dealing with an absent family member. However, the song's lyrics are somewhat abstract and disjointed, which might make it difficult for the user to find a clear and direct connection to their specific experience of sitting down for dinner and noticing the empty chair. The lyrical coherence is lower because the abstract nature and fragmented structure of the lyrics might hinder the user's ability to fully engage with the song during a moment of acute emotional distress."
"I just discovered a heartfelt letter from my childhood friend tucked inside an old book, and I was completely caught off guard.",i got a surprise from my honey i got a message from my girl when she picked up a pen from the side of the bed and wrote me a scribbled note that she was coming back to see me she was visiting real soon gonna get up from the long white bed and leave this cold white room wah ooo wah ooo wah ooo we would once more live together go out on a loving spree just like before the accident my baby would look at me i saw her sweet face trembling as she tried to open her eyes i jumped with the joy of a grateful boy the day my baby gave me a surprise wah ooo wah ooo wah ooo i got a surprise from my honey i got a message from my girl when she picked up a pen from the side of the bed and wrote me a scribbled note i saw her sweet face trembling as she tried to open her eyes i jumped with the joy of a grateful boy the day my baby gave me a surprise wah ooo wah ooo wah ooo,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.67,"The song captures the element of surprise and emotional impact similar to the user's experience of finding an unexpected letter, which aligns moderately well with the emotional aspect of the prompt. However, the context of the song, which revolves around a romantic relationship and a significant other recovering from an accident, diverges significantly from the nostalgic and platonic nature of discovering a childhood friend's letter. The lyrics, while somewhat repetitive with the 'wah ooo wah ooo' parts, maintain a basic narrative coherence but lack depth and complexity in storytelling. Overall, the song partially matches the emotional tone but misses the specific contextual and nostalgic elements of the user's experience."
I really look up to my brother. I hope I can be like him one day.,i hope my little brother puts a call in today i hope he don t forget where he came from i hope he never has to deal with wrongin someone cause i lived with many ghosts when i was younger and i will live with many ghosts until i go i hope he s right in the head i hope he s right in the head i hope he s right in the head even if he has to wrong someone and i hope his guardian angel puts a gun in his hand if ever they get ambushed or pursued i hope she sticks around when he does dirty in this dirty duel he s brewed and though the names will get changed to protect the innocent he said i hope the names will get changed to protect me cause i lived with many ghosts when i was younger and i will live with many ghosts until i go,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics reflect a complex and somewhat conflicted relationship with a brother, which does not align well with the user's simple admiration and aspiration. The emotional alignment is low because the song expresses more concern and worry rather than admiration or inspiration. Contextually, the song does mention a brother and hopes for him, which loosely fits the theme but diverges significantly in tone and content. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but can be confusing with references to ghosts, guns, and ambiguous scenarios, which detracts from a clear narrative or message."
I watched this concert today and couldn’t stop laughing and smiling. It just made me feel so light and entertained.,let s sit here in the breakdown lane let s ohh and ahh until the show stops the way it makes your face light up let s have a show of hands who s enjoying themselves i know i am,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The recommended song captures the emotion of joy and entertainment as reflected in the user's experience at the concert. The lyrics 'the way it makes your face light up' and 'who's enjoying themselves I know I am' align well with the user's feelings of laughter and smiling, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song mentions a performance ('until the show stops'), which loosely connects to the user's experience of watching a concert, though it's not a direct match to a concert setting, hence a moderate score. The lyrical coherence is average; the lyrics are somewhat fragmented and lack a smooth narrative flow, which might make it slightly harder to follow, but they still convey a clear sentiment of enjoyment and engagement."
I’m honestly so mad right now. I trusted someone again and they hurt me—how can people keep doing this?,there are people who i trust there are people who trust me and i don t know why they re choosing to confide in someone who will talk about anything there are people who i miss there are people who miss me and i don t know why they re investing all their time into someone with my history so now i m numb and it s because of everything my eyes are tired my body s tired of waking up and still being me,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of betrayal and disappointment, aligning well with the user's feelings of anger and hurt due to broken trust, scoring a 4 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on themes of trust and personal history, which is relevant to the user's situation, but it focuses more on self-reflection and personal weariness rather than directly addressing the act of being hurt by someone else, resulting in a score of 3. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and abstract but maintain a clear narrative about trust and emotional exhaustion, earning a 4 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song resonates fairly well with the user's emotional state and context, but might not fully capture the specific incident of betrayal as described by the user."
"There’s this person I deal with regularly, and the way he speaks just really irritates me. I don’t know why it gets to me so much.",i m so frustrated some things are making me so sick inside aw go with your heart go with your heart yeah right quit tugging me aw i m just not good enough for you let s change let s be something we re not let s be something everybody else is ah so much built up inside it s fucking ridiculous i don t know if i should freak the fuck out on you or just sit back and laugh you want more you don t have anything me me i have everything yeah i have everything what more could i ask for nothing at all why did it have to be this way at the end why did it have to be this way at the end 1,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics chosen reflect a high level of frustration and irritation, aligning well with the user's emotional state regarding their irritation with someone's speech. This scores a 4 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song deals with interpersonal conflict and emotional turmoil, which is somewhat relevant to the user's situation, scoring a 3. However, the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, which might make it difficult for some listeners to follow or find meaningful coherence, thus scoring a 2 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song could resonate with the user's feelings but might be less effective due to its lyrical presentation."
Someone at work has been handling things incredibly well. I just wanted to say I genuinely respect how he manages everything.,he is a mighty good god for him there s nothing to hard there is no problem he can t solve he is the lord of all in him i find no fault in him there is no failure in him i will not lack he is the lord of all in you i find no fault in you there is no failure in you i will not lack you are the lord of all you are the lord of all yes you are yes you are you are the lord of all ,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The song's lyrics focus on praising and acknowledging the omnipotence and perfection of a divine figure, which only slightly aligns with the user's intention to express respect for a colleague's management skills. The emotional alignment is low because the song conveys a sense of worship and reverence, which is more intense and spiritual than the professional respect and admiration intended in the prompt. Contextually, the song is also not very relevant as it addresses spiritual themes rather than workplace dynamics or professional competence. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and simplistic but maintain a basic level of fluency and coherence, hence the slightly higher score in lyrical coherence."
"I’ve been taking care of a little bunny for a couple of years, and I feel so responsible for his well-being. He means a lot to me.",you know that i care what happens to you and i know that you care for me so i don t feel alone or the weight of the stone now that i ve found somewhere safe to bury my bone and any fool knows a dog needs a home a shelter from pigs on the wing,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of care and responsibility, aligning well with the user's emotional state regarding their attachment and responsibility towards their bunny. This scores high in emotional alignment. However, the song's reference to a dog and its needs, while metaphorically relevant, does not directly align with the specific context of caring for a bunny, leading to a lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat poetic and metaphorical, which might require interpretation, but they maintain a reasonable level of coherence, expressing a clear sentiment of needing a safe space and mutual care."
I just got here and I feel completely disoriented. I don’t understand what’s going on or what I’m supposed to be doing.,i don t know who you think you are i don t know what you re doing here i don t know what s going on here i don t know how it s supposed to be i i don t have the vaguest notion whose it is what it s all for i don t know i m not crying laughin mostly as you can see,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics strongly resonate with the user's feelings of disorientation and confusion, as reflected in the repeated expressions of not knowing what's happening or what is expected. This aligns well emotionally and contextually with the user's situation. The lyrics, while somewhat repetitive, maintain a coherent theme of uncertainty and bewilderment, though they could benefit from a bit more structure to enhance understanding. Overall, the song captures the essence of the user's emotional and contextual state effectively."

The context of exploring new ideas and topics is somewhat mirrored in the lyrics through the exploration of new perceptions and feelings towards another person, though it's more focused on interpersonal relationships rather than intellectual curiosity, leading to a moderate score in contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is lower due to the somewhat disjointed and stream-of-consciousness style of the lyrics, which may make it harder for the user to find a clear and fluent narrative or message."
"More than anything right now, I just want to grow and improve. I want to become someone I can be proud of.",we can pretend who we can be a dancer in a top hat or a captain of the sea i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song's lyrics reflect a strong desire for self-expression and authenticity, aligning well with the user's emotional need for personal growth and self-improvement. The repeated lines 'I just want to be myself for everyone to see' resonate with the user's aspiration to become someone they can be proud of, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on themes of identity and self-acceptance which are relevant to the user's focus on personal development, though it does not directly address the aspect of growth or improvement. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and simplistic but maintain a clear message about being true to oneself. Overall, the song is a good match for the user's emotional and contextual needs, though it could benefit from deeper lyrical complexity to fully encapsulate the user's desire for growth."
"I thought I could rely on someone close to me, but they let me down again. It hurts more than I expected.",i ve been so long without you i try not to think about you but i do i know that i m to blame i got no right to call your name but i do i do i m so hurt to think that you d lie to me i m hurt way down deep inside of me,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song captures the emotional essence of feeling let down by someone close, particularly through the lines 'I'm so hurt to think that you'd lie to me.' This aligns well with the user's feelings of hurt and disappointment. Contextually, the song seems to reflect a personal betrayal or disappointment, which fits the theme of being let down by someone trusted. The lyrics are coherent and express a clear emotional narrative of hurt and betrayal. However, the song might slightly miss the mark on the specific aspect of repeated disappointment as it focuses more on a singular instance of being hurt."
"I tried to accept things the way they are, but I can’t anymore. I don’t agree with what’s happening, and I think I need to walk away.",i m breaking out these walls can t hold me any longer days pass me by and i got stronger with every breath i ever took i doubted this world as a whole i refuse to live in a world that refuses me i refuse to live a life that isn t right for me i refuse i m breaking out when reality comes i ll shove it away and try to make it to another day i refuse,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.

It speaks to the discomfort in expressing oneself and the relief found in being understood by someone special, which resonates with the user's situation of feeling judged versus feeling accepted. Contextually, the song fits as it discusses the themes of communication and emotional comfort, though it doesn't directly address the scenario of being laughed at by others, which slightly lowers its contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat poetic and abstract, which might make them less directly relatable but maintain a good level of lyrical coherence with a clear narrative about finding solace in a comforting presence."

Emotional alignment scores low as the song's festive, holiday spirit does not match the specific anticipation and impatience expressed by the user about a new appliance. Contextually, the song is entirely irrelevant as it discusses Christmas and has no connection to cooking or kitchen appliances. The lyrics themselves are coherent and follow a consistent theme of Christmas and gift-giving, which is why the coherence score is relatively high. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional state or context."

The mention of feeling 'strange' and being 'scared' resonates with the user's described emotions. Contextually, the song touches on themes of loneliness and emotional distress, which can be relevant to the user's experience of a terrifying moment, though it does not directly address the sensation of an impending horrible event. The lyrics are coherent and convey a clear narrative of fear and discomfort, though some lines might seem slightly disjointed without the context of the entire song."
"I’ve been reflecting lately, and I just feel really grateful for everything and everyone that I have in my life.",i m grateful that now i can see that i am a part of everything and everything is a part of me you ve amazed me,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The recommended song lyrics align perfectly with the user's emotional state of gratitude, as the lyrics explicitly express a sense of gratefulness and interconnectedness with everything, which resonates with the user's feelings towards their life and relationships. The context of reflection and gratitude is directly addressed in the lyrics, making it highly relevant. The lyrics are mostly coherent and fluently express the sentiment of gratitude, though they are somewhat brief and could benefit from further elaboration to enhance their depth and impact."

The mention of being hurt and the ongoing impact of the absence resonates with the user's feeling of the enduring weight of loss. However, the song also introduces elements of betrayal ('think that you'd lie to me'), which might not perfectly align with the user's context if their loss was not due to deceit. The lyrics are coherent and express a clear emotional narrative, though they slightly deviate from the user's specific situation by introducing themes of blame and deceit."

The theme of the song, which revolves around saying goodbye to sadness and embracing happiness, fits the context of the user's prompt about a significant positive change in their life. The lyrics are coherent and flow well, although the repetitive structure might slightly affect the clarity or depth of the message. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's emotional state and context."

The context of love and infatuation is also relevant, earning a 3 in contextual relevance. However, the lyrics suffer from a lack of fluency and clarity, making them somewhat difficult to follow, which results in a coherence score of 2. Overall, the song captures the essence of the user's emotional state but struggles with lyrical clarity."

My knees were shaking the whole time.,this one brought me down to my knees i had to hold onto the wall my knees shaking quivering my head feels like a frisbee,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics align well emotionally with the user's experience of feeling overwhelmed and physically shaken, as indicated by the mention of being brought down to the knees and shaking. This mirrors the user's description of shaking knees and the inability to speak. Contextually, the lyrics are somewhat relevant as they describe a physical and emotional reaction that parallels the user's situation, though the exact scenario isn't perfectly matched. The coherence of the lyrics is somewhat lower, as the phrases are a bit disjointed and abstract, making it harder to grasp a clear, fluent narrative or message."

However, the song lacks a clear message of fighting for one's ideals or showing them to the world, which limits its emotional alignment score. Contextually, the song touches on themes of self-doubt and the search for new 'heroes' or ideals, which loosely connects to the user's situation of needing to assert their ideals. The lyrical coherence is low due to the repetitive and somewhat disjointed nature of the lyrics, making it difficult to follow a clear narrative or emotional progression."

However, the song's repetitive and somewhat disjointed lyrics lack a clear narrative or detailed context that matches the user's specific moment of clarity. The lyrics are not very coherent, with repetitive phrases that don't form a fluent or comprehensive narrative, making it difficult to fully grasp the message or emotion intended by the songwriter."
After today’s show I was finally able to relax for a while,let s sit here in the breakdown lane let s ohh and ahh until the show stops the way it makes your face light up let s have a show of hands who s enjoying themselves i know i am,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song's lyrics somewhat align with the emotion of relaxation after a show, as indicated by phrases like 'let's sit here' and 'enjoying themselves'. However, the mention of a 'breakdown lane' and 'show of hands' might not perfectly capture the serene, unwinding atmosphere typically associated with relaxation. Contextually, the lyrics touch on the theme of a show but seem to focus more on an ongoing or interactive aspect rather than the post-show relaxation the user describes. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative flow, making them moderately coherent. Overall, the song partially matches the user's emotional and contextual needs but could be more focused and fluent to better serve the purpose."
"The more I think about it, the more I realize I made a terrible mistake. I really regret what I did.",please accept my humble apology s should ve never happened o oh my god how could i r rotten thing to do r really didn t mean it y why d i have to go and do a thing like that i m sorry so sorry i m so sorry darling sorry well ,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.3,"The song's lyrics strongly align with the emotion of regret expressed in the user's prompt, as it repeatedly emphasizes apologies and remorse, which is why it scores high on emotional alignment. The context of seeking forgiveness or expressing regret in the song matches the user's situation of realizing a mistake and regretting it, hence the high score in contextual relevance. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low due to the disjointed and somewhat repetitive structure of the lyrics, which can make it difficult to follow or feel impactful. Overall, the song is a good match in terms of emotion and context but falls short in lyrical clarity and fluency."

I just feel this overwhelming sadness I don’t know how to handle.,i can t take anymore i can t breathe i m sick of this goddamn darkness sick of sadness and tears i throw it all up every single day together with last night s dinner i have lost myself completely i have convinced myself i am someone else for god s sake i need to be real i need touch i need people i have to turn my life around but i will still be myself won t i ,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics strongly align with the user's emotional state of overwhelming sadness and the inability to cope, as reflected in the lyrics' expressions of despair and a desire for change. However, the song's context of self-loathing and extreme personal distress might be more intense than what the user described, leading to a slightly lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is somewhat lower due to the lack of punctuation and fragmented thoughts, which might make it harder for the user to find a clear and comforting message in the song."
My family just told me something completely unexpected...

This scores a 3 in emotional alignment as it touches on the theme of unexpected events but doesn't delve into the personal or familial aspect specifically. Contextually, the song's mention of unexpected events and changes aligns well with the user's situation, scoring a 4. However, the lyrics lack a bit of fluency and are somewhat repetitive and vague, which makes it harder to follow a clear narrative or message, resulting in a coherence score of 2. Overall, the song moderately addresses the user's emotional and contextual needs but could be improved in lyrical clarity and direct relevance to the personal nature of the user's situation."
