Your dedication to volunteering is truly inspiring.,what you are doing is invaluable what you are doing is invaluable ,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics, though repetitive, align moderately well with the emotional tone of appreciation and inspiration mentioned in the prompt. The context of the lyrics, emphasizing the value of the user's actions, fits well with the theme of dedication to volunteering. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low due to the repetitive nature and lack of depth or variation in the lyrics, which could limit the song's ability to fully engage or resonate with the listener on a deeper level."
That joke about the cat wearing a tie made me laugh until I cried.,you crush me severely sincerely i signed my heart your letter said i laughed but you weren t joking i laughed but you weren t joking,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song captures the emotion of laughter to some extent, as indicated by the repeated lines 'I laughed but you weren't joking.' This suggests a misunderstanding or a mismatch in emotional reactions, similar to laughing at something unexpectedly serious. However, the emotional depth of the song seems to veer towards a more serious or somber tone rather than the light-hearted, joyful laughter described in the user's prompt. Contextually, the song does not directly relate to the humorous scenario of a cat wearing a tie, as it lacks any thematic or narrative elements about humor or animals. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative flow, making them moderately coherent but not entirely fluent or impactful."
I can't believe you deleted all my work without asking!,there s no one anywhere waiting for you i do not have a job to do i ll spend damn night recording or i could wonder about you who needs anything to write about i got all the reason to sleep all day and play the night out or i could wonder about you or i could wonder about you do do do dah dah,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of frustration and disbelief over their work being deleted. The song's lyrics suggest a lackadaisical, carefree attitude, focusing on having no responsibilities and choosing to spend time leisurely, which contrasts sharply with the user's distress. Contextually, the song does not address or relate to themes of loss, betrayal, or professional setbacks, making it irrelevant to the situation described. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, lacking a clear narrative or coherent message, which affects the lyrical coherence score."

The lyrics express anger towards a neighbor, aligning well with the emotional tone of the user's prompt. Contextually, the song deals with unwanted disturbances and a desire for peace, which fits the theme of the user's annoyance with noise. The lyrics, while expressive, are somewhat repetitive and could benefit from greater clarity in conveying a more structured narrative, hence the slightly lower score in lyrical coherence."

I don't understand why the router light is flashing red.,i will not lie about what it looked like a flashing light on the outside overhead how was i supposed to know the difference between the roads the one that i chose led this way i will not lie about what it looked like a flashing light on the outside overhead how was i supposed to know the difference between the roads the one that i chose led this way the one that i chose led this way,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song lyrics mention a 'flashing light,' which loosely connects to the user's issue with a flashing router light. However, the emotional and contextual alignment is minimal. The song seems to metaphorically discuss choices and paths in life, rather than addressing the frustration or confusion about a technical issue. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and vague, which affects their coherence, though they maintain a basic fluency. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional state or the specific context of their problem."

The lyrics focus more on existential and philosophical questions about creation, human significance, and a satirical take on space exploration, rather than providing any scientific or factual information about black holes. The emotional tone of the song does not match the curiosity and quest for knowledge implied in the user's prompt. Contextually, the song does not address the specific topic of black holes in a meaningful way. The lyrical coherence is low, as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and veer off into various unrelated topics, making it difficult to follow a coherent narrative or theme."
I'm dying to try that new Japanese restaurant.,and tomorrow they ll be new delights for you to discover in this adventure that is japan,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of anticipation and exploration, which aligns somewhat with the user's excitement about trying a new Japanese restaurant. However, the emotional intensity of the lyrics is not very strong, hence a score of 2 for emotional alignment. The lyrics are contextually relevant as they mention 'adventure that is Japan,' directly relating to the Japanese theme of the user's prompt, earning a score of 4. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, presenting a clear idea of exploring new delights, but they lack a bit of fluency and depth, resulting in a score of 3 for lyrical coherence. Overall, the song moderately matches the user's prompt with an overall score of 3."

The mention of not amounting to anything and feeling dormant resonates with the frustration and stagnation the user might feel. Contextually, the song touches on themes of unmet expectations and personal struggle, which is relevant but not directly about workplace or financial expectations, hence the slightly lower score. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, presenting a clear narrative of disappointment and self-doubt, though the flow and connection between ideas could be smoother to enhance understanding."
It's not okay that you arrive so late without letting me know.,6 o clock in the morning and you re still not here baby i can t find you nowhere you gave no warning staying out late with somebody you don t really care,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of frustration and concern about someone being late, which aligns well with the emotion of the user's prompt. The context of someone being late and not communicating effectively is also relevant to the scenario described in the prompt. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, but they could be clearer in conveying a complete narrative or emotion, as they seem slightly disjointed and lack detailed explanation of the situation."
The smell of rotten food was unbearable.,yeah yeah when i walk on by i smell like shit and i m covered in flys i pimp to the beat eat from the garbage on the street yeah this is how i role paper bag pants out of control,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional or contextual prompt. The emotion conveyed by the user's prompt is one of disgust or discomfort due to the smell of rotten food, which is not reflected in the song's playful and somewhat humorous tone about being unkempt and associated with garbage. Contextually, the song mentions smelling bad and being connected to garbage, which loosely relates to the idea of rotten food but does not directly address the specific scenario described. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear, sensible narrative, focusing more on a quirky depiction of a disheveled lifestyle rather than a structured story or emotion."
I fell in front of everyone and felt myself blush.,today i saw somebody who looked just like you she walked like you do i thought it was you and as she turned the corner i called out your name i felt so ashamed when it wasn t you wasn t you you are everything and everything is you oh you are everything and everything is you oh you are everything and everything is you how can i forget when each face that i see brings back memories of being with you oh baby i just can t go on living life as i do comparing each girl with you knowing they just won t do you are everything and everything is you oh you are everything and everything is you oh you are everything and everything is you,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional experience of embarrassment and self-consciousness after falling in front of everyone. The song's theme revolves around seeing someone who reminds the singer of a past relationship, which is unrelated to the user's experience of public embarrassment. The emotional alignment score is low because the song's focus on nostalgia and lost love does not reflect the user's feelings of acute embarrassment. Contextually, the song is also irrelevant as it does not address or relate to the situation of falling or the associated emotions. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent theme throughout, which warrants a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
We're going on a trip tomorrow—how exciting!,and tomorrow they ll be new delights for you to discover in this adventure that is japan,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,"The song lyrics align well with the emotion of excitement about a trip, as indicated by the mention of 'new delights' and 'adventure.' The context of going on a trip is directly addressed with references to discovering new things in a specific location, Japan, which fits the theme of travel. The lyrics are coherent and create a clear image of anticipation and exploration, though they are somewhat brief and could benefit from more detailed storytelling to enhance the emotional impact."
I heard footsteps behind me on the dark street and got scared.,late at night and i m walking the street right behind me cops on my beat i look ahead and i want to run i want to shoot them but i got no gun and i said whatever happened to the life that i was once i am afraid but i don t understand about it why do these hard times keep crawling up on me well i don t know late at night and i m lying in bed some crazy thought running through my head i m not sleeping and i don t know why i know that soon my story won t fly ,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of fear and anxiety, aligning well with the user's emotional state of being scared while hearing footsteps behind them. This earns a high score in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song mentions walking late at night and feeling a sense of fear, which is relevant to the user's experience of being scared on a dark street. However, the mention of cops and thoughts of shooting, although adding to the tension, diverge somewhat from the user's specific scenario of just hearing footsteps, thus the contextual relevance score is moderate. The lyrical coherence is somewhat lower as the lyrics are a bit disjointed and rambling, making it harder to follow a clear narrative or message."
Thank you for staying with me when I was sick.,thank you jesus was it you indeed to flirt unkindly with my greed promising eternal life when you knew it was not right when you knew that what i d need was willingness and comfort there ,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional and contextual prompt. The user's prompt expresses gratitude towards someone for their support during illness, seeking a tone of appreciation and comfort. The song lyrics, however, discuss a critical and questioning perspective towards a figure (Jesus), focusing on themes of deceit and unfulfilled promises, which contrasts sharply with the gratitude and personal support expressed in the prompt. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, presenting a clear critique, but they do not match the emotional or contextual needs of the prompt, leading to low scores in these areas."

The context of the song, which revolves around a house that once felt like a home but now feels empty and abandoned, perfectly matches the user's situation, thus scoring a 5 in contextual relevance. The lyrics are mostly coherent and tell a clear story, though the repetitive nature might slightly hinder the clarity, resulting in a score of 4 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song is highly suitable for the user's emotional and contextual needs, with a slight deduction in coherence."
Everything went perfectly today; I feel incredibly happy.,i used to be a fool and think that life was cruel and full of hate but now i see things are not so bad if only i had had someone to hold my hand like you i d do it then i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now and now that i am free from all that misery and i can smile again cause you came into my life said you d be my wife and made me realize that life is wonderful and i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"The song's lyrics strongly align with the user's emotional state of feeling 'incredibly happy,' as it repeatedly emphasizes happiness and a positive change in life, scoring a 5 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song fits well with the theme of a significant positive shift, likely due to a loving relationship, which is a common source of joy, scoring a 4. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety in expression, which might affect the depth of engagement with the lyrics, scoring a 3. Overall, the song is a good match for the user's mood and situation, but could benefit from more lyrical diversity."
I adore you with all my heart.,in you i find my home completely known completely loved and wanted you re utterly in love with me my closest friend,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song lyrics align perfectly with the emotion of adoration expressed in the user's prompt, reflecting a deep, personal connection and love, which scores a 5 in emotional alignment. The context of expressing love and adoration is directly addressed in the lyrics, which mention being 'completely loved and wanted' and being 'utterly in love', thus scoring a 5 in contextual relevance. The lyrics are mostly coherent and fluently express the sentiments of love and companionship, though they could benefit from slightly more structure to enhance clarity, resulting in a score of 4 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's prompt, effectively capturing the essence of deep affection and companionship."
I've got knots in my stomach before the interview.,oh i m fainting i don t stand a chance meat is murder and i don t even dance something is still worrying me tonight oh i m falling nothing is working out and what comes out from my mouth is nothing to worry about cause everything sounds miserable tonight i haven t said too much have i there are things you should keep to yourself,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.67,"The song captures a sense of anxiety and discomfort, which aligns with the user's emotional state of having 'knots in their stomach' due to nervousness. However, the lyrics delve more into a general sense of despair and confusion, which might not directly relate to the specific context of preparing for an interview. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, but the abrupt shifts in topic from personal anxiety to broader statements about life and societal issues can make the overall message less clear. The song partially matches the emotional state but lacks direct relevance to the specific scenario of an interview."

Contextually, the song fits the theme of looking forward to better times and personal growth, which matches the user's prompt about the next year being better. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat lower due to the repetitive nature and somewhat disjointed phrases, which might make it harder for some listeners to follow the narrative or message clearly."
I submitted the project ahead of the deadline and feel proud.,my pride you you are my cause i spend time my pride i will and i ll stand here with my pride and fight forest gospel oh oh oh,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,"The song's mention of 'pride' loosely connects to the user's feeling of pride in completing a project. However, the emotional alignment is weak as the song does not specifically address the feeling of accomplishment or the context of completing a project. The lyrics are disjointed and lack fluency, making it difficult to discern a clear narrative or theme that relates to the user's situation. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional state or the context of their achievement."
Now I see I was looking for answers in the wrong place.,i thought that i could go on i guess that i was wrong no matter how hard i try i just can t find a way to figure me out,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"The recommended song lyrics align well with the user's emotional state of realization and confusion, as expressed in the prompt. The lyrics reflect a similar sentiment of struggling to find answers or understanding oneself, which matches the user's feeling of searching in the wrong place. The context of self-discovery and introspection in the lyrics is relevant to the theme of the user's realization. The lyrics are coherent and express a clear emotional struggle, though they are somewhat repetitive which slightly limits their depth. Overall, the song is a good match for the user's emotional and contextual needs."
They took off the cast and I can finally walk without pain.,let me down now i m falling off the line and i can feel it crawling through my spine because in my room now i feel so divine not a worry running through my mind,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.

The context of seeking forgiveness is also well-matched, hence a high score in contextual relevance. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low due to the disjointed and somewhat repetitive nature of the lyrics, which could make it harder for the listener to follow or feel fully engaged with the song's message."
The constant rain makes me feel melancholic.,sometimes i feel like i m dying at dawn and sometimes i m warm as fire but lately i feel like i m just gonna rain and it goes over and over and over again yeah too many flames with too much to burn and life s only made of paper oh how i need to be free of this pain but it goes over and over and over and over again yeah sometimes i cry for the lost and alone and for their dreams that will all be ashes but lately i feel like i m just gonna rain and it goes over and over and over and over again,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of melancholy, aligning well with the user's emotional state induced by the constant rain. The repeated phrases 'I feel like I'm just gonna rain' and the overall tone of sadness and repetition match the user's feelings of melancholy, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the lyrics metaphorically use weather (rain) to express emotional states, which is relevant to the user's mention of rain affecting their mood. However, the coherence of the lyrics suffers slightly due to the somewhat disjointed thoughts and lack of a clear narrative structure, making it a bit challenging to follow the storyline or the exact message intended by the songwriter."
"I didn't expect to see you here, what a surprise!",here they come boy what a surprise they re gonna get let s go ,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,"The emotional alignment of the recommended song is low as it does not capture the pleasant or neutral surprise typically associated with unexpectedly meeting someone. Instead, it suggests a more confrontational or aggressive scenario. Contextually, the mention of a surprise aligns slightly with the user's prompt, but the nature of the surprise seems vastly different, leading to a low score. The lyrical coherence is also low as the lyrics are fragmented and lack clear narrative or fluency, making it difficult to grasp the full context or emotion intended."
Your perseverance in finishing that marathon left me speechless.,time after time i look back to see the wonderful things that you ve done for me and just when i thought that this was the end you came down from heaven to rescue your friend never imagined your love was so strong it took all my burdens and fixed all my wrongs started to think you couldn t do no more but you surpassed what you did before and you never cease to amaze me i can say you ve never failed me you are amazing god there were tears on my face wondering how my pass you d erase so undeserving of all that you i m still alive and it s all cause of you never imagined your love was so strong it took all my burdens and fixed all my wrongs started to think you couldn t do no more but you surpassed what you did before you have done please forgive i made mistakes you still forgave that s why i still say lord oh i am amazed oh i am amazed oh i am mazed oh i am amazed oh i am amazed oh i am mazed oh i am amazed oh i am amazed oh i am mazed ,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song's lyrics focus on themes of amazement and gratitude towards a higher power, which aligns somewhat with the emotion of being 'speechless' due to someone's perseverance. However, the context of the song, which seems to be about divine intervention and personal redemption, does not closely match the context of completing a marathon, which is typically a personal achievement. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative structure, which affects their coherence. Overall, while there is some emotional alignment, the contextual relevance and lyrical coherence are limited."
Watching the penguin slide on its belly cracked me up.,i saw the creature fall into the swamp from which he spawned i heard them laugh and say they never liked him anyway i tried to talk to them to help you on your feet again they laughed and said to me the swamp is right where i should be the creature lives the creature lives the creature lives the creature lives,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not align well with the user's prompt. The emotional tone of the prompt is light-hearted and humorous, focusing on the amusing sight of a penguin sliding on its belly. However, the song lyrics depict a darker, more negative scenario involving a creature falling into a swamp and being mocked, which contrasts sharply with the joyful and playful nature of the user's experience. Contextually, the song also misses the mark as it does not relate to the playful or animal-related theme suggested by the prompt. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent in their narrative, but they do not make complete sense in relation to the prompt, hence the score for lyrical coherence is moderately low."
I'm furious that the package arrived completely broken.,so many took me for granted double crossed me for the bag when it landed i m thinkin you not the only fucking plug on this planet i m patient unfamiliar aircraft in sight,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of fury over a broken package. The song's lyrics seem to express betrayal and frustration, which only slightly touches on the user's anger but does not specifically address the situation of receiving a damaged item. The context of the song, which appears to involve deceit and broader issues of trust, is not relevant to the user's experience with a broken package. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear narrative or fluency that would make them more impactful or relevant to the user's situation."

The song's theme of floating and escaping to a higher, lighter place contrasts sharply with the grounded, aggravating experience described in the prompt. The lyrics are somewhat coherent with a clear motif of escaping and floating, but they lack direct relevance to the specific context of the user's frustration. Overall, the song does not effectively address or resonate with the emotional or contextual aspects of the user's situation."
That's exactly the solution we needed—well done!,you know we got a great thing here,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,"The recommended song lyrics 'you know we got a great thing here' align well with the positive and congratulatory emotion of the user's prompt, which celebrates a solution or achievement. The emotional alignment is strong as the lyrics reflect a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Contextually, the lyrics are somewhat relevant as they imply success and a positive outcome, which fits the theme of finding a solution. The lyrics are coherent and straightforward, making them easy to understand and relate to. Overall, the song matches well with the user's emotional state and context, though it could be more specific to the idea of 'solving a problem' to achieve a perfect score."
Take your coat; it's chilly and I don't want you catching a cold.,put on your cap and your coat come on come on it s time to go bundle up cause don t you know that outside it s pouring down snow wrap that big old scarf around your pretty little neck put on your boots and don t forget watch out for that ice hiding in the cracks of the pavement hey baby bundle up tight tis the season to catch a cold and die make sure that you stay warm don t go out in the cold no more then you have to or you ll get sick for sure and if you do catch the flu or just a sneeze you can count on me to bring you soup or let you wipe your nose on my sleeve,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,"The song lyrics align well emotionally with the user's prompt, emphasizing care and concern about someone going out in cold weather, which reflects a protective and caring sentiment. Contextually, the song is highly relevant as it directly addresses the need to wear appropriate clothing in cold weather and the risks associated with not doing so, perfectly fitting the theme of the prompt. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story about preparing for cold weather and the consequences of neglecting to do so, though the mention of 'catch a cold and die' might be seen as slightly hyperbolic, slightly affecting the coherence score."

However, the context of the song, which delves into artistic struggle and existentialism, does not directly relate to the user's frustration with technical or procedural issues like multiple logins. The repetition of the phrase 'why is it me singing the same song' could metaphorically mirror the user's annoyance with redundancy, but this is a loose connection at best. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, though they meander through various abstract ideas without a clear narrative, making them only moderately easy to follow."
I've always wondered what the surface of Mars smells like.,the virgin mary on a chain has hit me in the mouth again as we explore the carnal score of sacred and profane sulky boy won t drink his milk so mother s breast beneath the silk remains untouched it s way too much reject all of that ilk i have to say it makes me wonder if you are holding me to the same blue flame that you re under cause i feel you scolding me it makes me wonder it makes me wonder your virgin mary s in the way hallucinate her face by day obscure the view in front of you it s me here made of clay you re playing near that line so thin austerity or just give in to endless appetite embrace that white oblivion i have to say it makes me wonder if you are holding me to that cold blue flame that you re under when you are holding me  and why so high the expectation who could live up to this and there s no time now for explanation cool as an angel s kiss and i have to say it makes me wonder if you are holding me to that cold blue flame that you re under when you are holding me it makes me wonder it makes me wonder it makes me wonder it makes me wonder ,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The song lyrics provided do not align with the user's curiosity about the smell of Mars, as they delve into themes of religious imagery, personal relationships, and introspection, which are unrelated to the user's interest in a planetary feature. The emotional tone of the song, which seems to explore conflict and introspection, does not match the neutral, inquisitive nature of the user's prompt. The lyrics themselves maintain a certain level of coherence with a consistent theme and narrative style, though they are somewhat abstract and cryptic. Overall, the song does not effectively address the user's specific curiosity about Mars, making it a poor match both emotionally and contextually."
I really crave a steaming cup of hot chocolate right now.,i need thee oh i need thee every hour i need thee oh bless me now my savior im thirsty thirsty for you i am thirsty oh o oh o i am oh o oh o ,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The song's emotional alignment scores low as it reflects a deep spiritual or existential need, which is quite different from the casual, comforting desire for hot chocolate expressed in the prompt. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it discusses a spiritual thirst, which does not align with the physical craving for a beverage. The lyrical coherence is slightly better, as the repetition and structure convey a clear, though simple, message of need and longing, but it lacks complexity and depth in narrative."
"I studied all week, but the exam covered none of the material.",i had a conversation it lasted nearly an hour held no words and carried the weight of the state of things so held,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The recommended song lyrics seem to express a sense of frustration and weightiness, which aligns somewhat with the user's feeling of disappointment and frustration after studying hard for an exam that didn't reflect their preparation. However, the song doesn't directly address academic or exam-related themes, making its contextual relevance low. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, presenting a clear image of a heavy, wordless conversation, but they do not directly connect to the user's specific situation of feeling unprepared for an unexpected exam scope."
Leaving dirty dishes in the sink overnight isn't acceptable.,we cannot continue this unauthorized content unauthorized content,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics provided are repetitive and nonsensical, containing only the phrase 'unauthorized content' repeated twice. This does not align with the emotional tone or context of the user's prompt about leaving dirty dishes in the sink, which typically involves feelings of frustration or negligence. Additionally, the lyrics lack any coherent message or narrative, making them irrelevant to the user's situation."
The sight of mold growing on that bread makes my stomach churn.,it s killing me it s killing me oh the weight is killing me now that the alkaline taste in my mouth it goes through my throat into my nose and i know it s going to kill me,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of discomfort and distress, which aligns well with the user's emotional response of disgust and unease caused by the sight of mold. This earns a high score in emotional alignment. However, the context of the song, which seems to describe a more intense, possibly life-threatening situation, does not perfectly align with the relatively milder context of moldy bread, thus receiving a lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, expressing a clear progression of sensations and reactions, but the abstract and dramatic expression might confuse the literal context of mold on bread."
My phone started playing loud music in the quiet library.,waking up feeling good and limber when the telephone it ring was a bad man from california telling of a stone he d bring i d bring and of better days from this town we d escape if we holler loud and make our way we d all live one big holiday so we listened and up the river and recorded all the sounds was some shaking and some record playing all the leather kids were loud,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The song's lyrics do not align well with the user's prompt of a phone playing loud music in a quiet library. The emotional alignment is low because the song's upbeat and adventurous tone contrasts sharply with the likely embarrassment or annoyance of the situation described. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it discusses themes of escape and adventure, which have no connection to the quiet library scenario. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, with a clear narrative about receiving a call and the subsequent actions, though they are slightly abstract and disjointed in places."

The context of the song, involving a group of friends going to a concert, directly mirrors the user's situation of planning to attend a concert, making it highly relevant (Contextual relevance: 5). The lyrics, while vivid and narrative, include some disjointed transitions and a focus on a specific incident that might not universally resonate, slightly affecting the lyrical coherence (Coherence: 3). Overall, the song matches the user's prompt well, capturing the shared experience of attending a memorable concert with friends."
The storm shook the windows so hard I thought they would shatter.,on the 14th day of april of 1935 there struck the worst of dust storms that ever filled the sky you could see that dust storm comin the cloud looked deathlike black and through our mighty nation it left a dreadful track from oklahoma city to the arizona line dakota and nebraska to the lazy rio grande it fell across our city like a curtain of black rolled down we thought it was our judgement we thought it was our doom the radio reported we listened with alarm the wild and windy actions of this great mysterious storm from albuquerque and clovis and all new mexico they said it was the blackest that ever they had saw from old dodge city kansas the dust had rung their knell and a few more comrades sleeping on top of old boot hill from denver colorado they said it blew so strong they thought that they could hold out but they didn t know how long our relatives were huddled into their oil boom shacks and the children they was cryin as it whistled through the cracks and the family it was crowded into their little room they thought the world had ended and they thought it was their doom the storm took place at sundown it lasted through the night when we looked out next morning we saw a terrible sight we saw outside our window where wheat fields they had grown was now a rippling ocean of dust the wind had blown it covered up our fences it covered up our barns it covered up our tractors in this wild and dusty storm we loaded our jalopies and piled our families in we rattled down that highway to never come back again,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,"The song lyrics describe a severe dust storm, capturing the fear and devastation experienced by those affected. Emotional alignment scores a 4 as the lyrics convey a strong sense of doom and anxiety, similar to the fear of windows shattering during a storm in the user's prompt. Contextual relevance is excellent, scoring a 5, as both the song and the prompt deal with the theme of a powerful storm impacting human lives. Lyrical coherence receives a 4; the lyrics are fluent and tell a coherent story of the storm's impact, though the narrative style is somewhat repetitive and historical, which might slightly disconnect from the immediate personal fear expressed in the prompt."
I can't thank you enough for covering my shift yesterday.,i just want to say thank you for this day masking my dismay thank you for this day,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.67,"The song's repeated expression of thanks aligns moderately well with the user's emotion of gratitude, scoring a 3 in emotional alignment. However, the mention of 'masking my dismay' introduces a conflicting emotion that isn't present in the user's prompt, which is purely thankful. Contextually, the song scores a 2 as it generally fits the theme of gratitude but lacks specificity regarding the act of covering a shift, which is central to the user's situation. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and vague but maintain basic fluency, earning a 3 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song partially matches the emotional and contextual needs of the user but could be more specific and aligned to the situation described."
"Every corner of the house reminds me of him, and it hurts.",i know there is it all away it all goes round the house today the reason why you re losing time the sadman calls he calls for you he cries for you he cries for you the sadman calls he calls for me the things you say the songs that shine for another time i count the ways your smile s the place the sadman calls he calls for you he cries for you you hurt my feelings you re losing me the sadman cries he cries for me,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of loss and sadness, which aligns well with the user's emotional state of being reminded of someone and feeling hurt. This earns a high score in emotional alignment. The mention of 'the house' and the recurring presence of another person in the lyrics also somewhat aligns with the user's context of being in a house filled with memories, thus the moderate score in contextual relevance. However, the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, lacking clear narrative or fluency, which impacts the coherence score negatively. Overall, the song captures the mood but struggles with clarity and narrative structure."
I can't stop smiling after getting that positive news.,i used to be a fool and think that life was cruel and full of hate but now i see things are not so bad if only i had had someone to hold my hand like you i d do it then i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now and now that i am free from all that misery and i can smile again cause you came into my life said you d be my wife and made me realize that life is wonderful and i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"The song's lyrics perfectly capture the emotion of happiness and a positive change in life, aligning well with the user's feeling of joy after receiving good news. The repeated expressions of happiness and life transformation in the song mirror the user's current emotional state, scoring high in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song fits the theme of a significant, positive life change, though it specifically mentions a romantic relationship as the source of happiness, which may not directly relate to the user's situation, hence the slightly lower score. The lyrics, while expressive and relevant, lack some variety and complexity, leading to a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
Being around you makes everything else fade away.,when everything you have goes away you realize that nothing means a thing everything you thought was a big deal now you see it all and what is real when all you have just falls apart nothing seems to work out right you re trying and you re still alright yeah you re still alright yeah you re still alright yeah you re still alright when everything starts to feel the same everyone around you seems to change you went along with me when things weren t right and when the morning slowly fades to light when all you have just falls apart nohting seems to work out right you re tryingg and you re still alright yeah you re still alright and you re still alright yeah you re still alright 2,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the emotional essence of the user's prompt, which is about the presence of someone making everything else seem insignificant. The lyrics focus more on personal resilience and the realization that material possessions or external circumstances are not as important when things fall apart, which only tangentially touches on the theme of relational significance. Contextually, the song does not directly address the theme of being absorbed by someone's presence, instead it discusses broader themes of personal realization and endurance. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and contain minor grammatical errors, but they maintain a consistent message about staying strong amidst challenges."
My hands are trembling before stepping onto the stage.,every time the music starts i can feel my aching shaking heart hey wait you hold on dear like a barnacle on a ship of fears and im out here like an island on a sea of tears if i could tear you away i would,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song captures the emotional intensity and nervousness associated with stepping onto a stage through phrases like 'aching shaking heart' and 'sea of tears,' which align well with the user's described trembling hands. However, the context of the song seems to delve more into personal struggle and emotional turmoil, which might not perfectly align with the specific scenario of stage fright. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making it harder to follow a clear narrative or message, thus scoring lower on lyrical coherence."
"Even after the setback, I believe our best days are ahead.",even the blind can see that everything around us is a sinking ship but there is still time to make things right to break the cycle of destruction there is still time to make things right but i need you cause i cant do this on my own i believe in us there s strength in unity our legacy as a generation will be faith that can move the mountains our light will shine through the darkest of night we will brighten the path for those who ve lost their way we will never stop fighting until you find your way home ,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics align well emotionally with the user's prompt, reflecting a sense of hope and resilience despite current challenges, which matches the user's belief that 'our best days are ahead.' Contextually, the song fits the theme of overcoming adversity and working together for a better future, resonating with the user's optimistic outlook. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, presenting a clear message of unity and perseverance, though the flow and structure might be slightly disjointed, affecting the overall coherence. Overall, the song is a good match for the user's emotional and contextual needs, providing a motivational and uplifting message."
Seeing my artwork displayed in the gallery fills me with pride.,my pride you you are my cause i spend time my pride i will and i ll stand here with my pride and fight forest gospel oh oh oh,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The song's repeated mentions of 'my pride' superficially align with the user's feeling of pride about their artwork being displayed. However, the song's context and lyrics seem to focus more on a personal or internal struggle, which doesn't directly relate to the pride derived from artistic achievement in a public setting. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack fluency, making it difficult to grasp a coherent message that would resonate deeply with the user's specific experience of seeing their artwork in a gallery."
It suddenly dawned on me that I'd been reading the map upside down.,where am i gonna land in the palm of someone s hand i should have known that the good part was over that you would leave at the end of the summer but the stakes were raised and so i looked the other way the sky turned red the world came true the way i wanted you i should have guessed that the moment was passing i didn t catch all the signs that were flashing cuz the stakes were raised and so i looked the other way all of my hoping just turned into lying kidding myself without even trying should have noticed the whole thing was dying but the stakes were raised and so i looked the other way the stakes were raised and so i looked the other way,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of realization and regret, which partially aligns with the emotion of sudden realization in the user's prompt. However, the theme of the song, which seems to focus on a relationship ending and missed signs, does not closely match the context of misreading a map. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent theme of missed opportunities and denial, but they lack clarity in directly conveying the story or emotions, which could make it difficult for the user to fully connect with the song based on their specific scenario."
"When the test results came back negative, I could finally breathe.",once i was very brave i stepped on that stage it took my breath away nerves caught around my neck i cried out for help no one was there my words turned into ash they went nowhere as if i m barely there collect my troubles spit out when i m told repeat it and i ll take what s left of my strength and get on my feet again on the tip of my tongue i breathe again i bury my stutter on the tip of my tongue i breathe again i bury my stutter,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song captures a sense of overcoming a challenging and anxiety-inducing situation, which aligns well with the user's emotion of relief and renewal after receiving negative test results. The lyrics metaphorically describe the struggle and eventual release of tension, similar to the user's experience. However, the song's primary focus on stage fright and public speaking doesn't perfectly match the medical or health-related context of the user's situation, hence the lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are coherent and convey a clear narrative of struggle and overcoming, which makes them relatively easy to follow and understand."

The context of the song, which revolves around seeking forgiveness and acknowledging one's mistakes, is somewhat relevant to the user's situation of missing a birthday party, though the song does not specifically mention such an event, making it slightly less directly relevant (Contextual relevance: 3). The lyrics are coherent and convey a clear message of remorse and the desire to make amends, though the repetitive structure might slightly hinder the overall clarity (Lyrical coherence: 4). Overall, the song is a good match for the user's feelings and situation, effectively communicating themes of regret and apology."

This aligns well emotionally, scoring a 4. Contextually, the song touches on themes of learning and being inspired by a sibling, which is relevant but not a perfect match to the specific scenario of guiding a child's first steps, thus scoring a 3. The lyrical coherence is somewhat low, as the lyrics are a bit disjointed and could be challenging to follow without the context of the musical, scoring a 2. Overall, the song moderately aligns with the user's emotional and contextual needs but could be clearer in its narrative."
I just finished a comedy movie and found myself laughing out loud through the entire end credits.,on my own in the back thought of death made me laugh summer s sun a sinking hole we were young and passionate we were young,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of joy and amusement after watching a comedy movie. The lyrics, which mention thoughts of death and a sinking hole, contrast starkly with the light-hearted and cheerful mood described in the prompt. Contextually, the song also misses the mark as it seems to evoke a more somber or reflective tone rather than complementing the comedic and uplifting experience. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear narrative or fluency, making it difficult to grasp a consistent theme or story."
"I just returned to my desk and found my meticulously organized files shredded and scattered everywhere, and I was absolutely furious.",got me fucked up,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics 'got me fucked up' do capture a general sense of frustration or anger, which aligns to some extent with the user's emotion of fury. However, the lyrics are extremely brief and lack depth, making it difficult to fully connect with the specific scenario of finding one's organized files destroyed. The context of the song is not clear from the lyrics provided, and they do not specifically address the situation of vandalism or the destruction of personal property, leading to a low score in contextual relevance. The coherence of the lyrics is also low due to their brevity and lack of detail, making it challenging to derive a clear and fluent narrative or emotional expression from them."

The lyrics seem to focus on a personal emotional struggle related to loneliness and possibly a breakup, which does not match the context of being disturbed by an external noise. The lyrics are somewhat coherent with a recurring theme of 'the paint was ripped off my front door,' but they do not clearly convey a specific, understandable narrative. Overall, the song does not effectively address the user's emotional or contextual needs."
"After staying up all night finishing that report, hearing my manager praise my work in the morning convinced me i’d made the right call.",listen to the sound listen to the sound everything always works out,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The recommended song lyrics align well emotionally, reflecting a sense of relief and validation, similar to the user's feelings after receiving praise for their hard work. Contextually, the lyrics are somewhat relevant as they suggest a positive outcome ('everything always works out'), which resonates with the user's experience of their decision being affirmed. The lyrics are coherent and straightforward, though they lack specific details that directly tie to the user's scenario of working through the night and being praised by a manager. Overall, the song captures the general mood and outcome but could be more contextually specific to the user's experience."
"My brother felt terrible all night, so I stayed by his side and made sure he had everything he needed.",well i spent all night alone with you and you weren t even there your eyes burned on me like the midnight sun and somewhere in the night i knew how much i really cared cause you re the one you re the one for me you are the one i tried to keep my distance afraid of striking out but protect myself from life is all i ve done so i got to tell you now before another night goes by that you re the one you re the one for me you are the one and sometimes it hits you right away and sometimes it takes awhile oh but now that you ve crept up on me there s nothing i can do to stay away from you though lord i ve tried to keep it down but resistance only moves it to the front so i got to tell you now and not worry what you ll say cause you re the one you re the one for me you are the one,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's emotional tone of longing and caring somewhat aligns with the user's emotional state of caring for their brother, but it primarily focuses on romantic love rather than familial or platonic care, which results in a lower score for emotional alignment. Contextually, the song does not fit well with the user's situation of caring for a sick brother, as it speaks more to an unrequited or burgeoning romantic relationship rather than a caregiving scenario. The lyrics themselves are moderately coherent, maintaining a consistent theme and narrative throughout, though they are somewhat repetitive and vague in places."

This suggests a revelation or secret, which matches the user's experience of uncovering a major secret. However, the song doesn't strongly convey the curiosity or anticipation of discovering more, which is a key part of the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song touches on secrets and surprises but doesn't directly relate to the idea of searching through archives or the thrill of discovery in a historical or informational context. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative flow, making them less coherent and harder to follow, which affects the overall effectiveness of the song in matching the user's prompt."

The user is excited about trying a new cooking recipe, specifically a chocolate soufflé, which is a delicate and sophisticated dessert. The song lyrics, however, repetitively focus on 'loads of cheese' and 'double cheese,' which are unrelated to the user's interest in making a chocolate soufflé. Additionally, the lyrics are repetitive and lack depth, which does not match the sophistication and excitement of cooking a new recipe. The coherence of the lyrics is also low due to their repetitive and simplistic nature."
"I opened the email to see that tonight’s concert had been canceled, leaving me utterly let down.",i was cut open on the way down reeling from the blow and you were there on the other line in between the tears and the lightshow what a disappointment i thought there d be so much more but all this talking is driving me insane and i was told if i was to sing along forget about myself we re all the same well maybe i should change my point of view dizzy in the morning and i m shaking in the afternoon there s never no warning when it s gonna hit and i m like an earthquake when i get thinking too much everything s falling and shaking and falling through my hands well maybe i should change my point of view well all this time we have together it s desperation for everybody it s wishful thinking for the whole human race or whoever 2,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song captures the emotion of disappointment and the feeling of being let down, which aligns well with the user's emotional state after finding out the concert was canceled. The lyrics express feelings of being overwhelmed and disillusioned ('what a disappointment'), which resonates with the user's situation. However, the song's context about personal turmoil and existential thoughts only partially matches the specific event of a canceled concert. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making them less coherent and harder to follow, which impacts the overall effectiveness of the song in addressing the user's prompt."
"I just found out the community center canceled the free cooking classes without telling me, and it felt unfair that they didn’t ask for my opinion.",i went to class you didn t show up i thought we said that we d keep in touch walk through town disassembled on a crutch just like we did when you were in love i left the house and i didn t miss much you opened your mouth and i lost my trust yeah i left the house for the first time in months for the first time in months now here i am disassembled as a whole when i got home i lost control,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of disappointment and betrayal, which aligns with the user's feelings of unfairness and being left out of decisions, scoring a 3 in emotional alignment. However, the context of the song, which seems to focus more on personal relationships and emotional breakdowns, only partially matches the user's situation regarding a community event, thus scoring a 2 in contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are quite coherent and express a clear narrative of disillusionment and emotional distress, earning a 4 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song moderately addresses the user's feelings and situation but could be more specifically relevant to the context of community and shared activities."
"I just took a bite of my sandwich and realized it had gone bad, making my stomach turn.",i realize i m hungry i recognize the pain in my gut i don t know where it comes from or what i m gonna do about it this little pain inside my tiny tummy souplantaion fosters freeze in n out or chuck e cheese burger king or taco bell all these restaurants sound so well that s what i m gonna do about it this little pain inside my tiny tummy hamburger helper on those days when i sit home and fucking laze and when my budget is kind of low there s only so many good places to go that s what i m gonna do about it this little pain inside my tiny tummy,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics focus on the sensation of hunger and the desire to eat at various fast food locations, which only partially aligns with the user's experience of eating something unpleasant. The emotional alignment is somewhat there as it deals with discomfort in the stomach, but it misses the mark on the negative reaction to spoiled food. Contextually, the song is more about deciding where to eat to satisfy hunger rather than dealing with the aftermath of eating something bad, making it less relevant. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but repetitive and simplistic, focusing more on listing food places than exploring the emotional depth of the situation."
I just waved enthusiastically at someone who wasn’t waving at me and wanted to disappear on the spot.,last night i saw someone with your eyes someone with your smile someone with your smile we danced and though glad that she had asked me to she didnt have your arms,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The recommended song lyrics touch slightly on the emotion of embarrassment or discomfort by mentioning an interaction with someone who resembles a past acquaintance, but it doesn't capture the acute embarrassment or desire to disappear as described in the user's prompt. Contextually, the song is more about reminiscing over someone who resembles a past love rather than dealing with a socially awkward situation. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, but they do not form a complete narrative or clearly convey a specific message, which affects their overall relevance and impact in relation to the prompt."
I just found out my best friend is flying in for a surprise visit and I can’t stop smiling.,i got a big surprise when i saw you smile i never dreamed that it could be but now i realize since i saw you smile there s only happiness for me so bye bye blues bye bye blues bells ring birds sing sun is shining no more pining just we two smiling thru don t sigh don t cry bye bye blues blues,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The song's lyrics perfectly capture the emotion of happiness and surprise, aligning well with the user's feelings of joy upon learning about their best friend's surprise visit. The repeated references to smiling and happiness in the lyrics mirror the user's emotional state, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song fits the theme of a joyful reunion, though it doesn't specifically mention a friend or a visit, which slightly lowers the contextual relevance score. The lyrics are coherent and flow well, with a cheerful tone that enhances the overall message, though the simplicity and repetition slightly affect the lyrical depth."
"I just got word my friend is driving here through this raging thunderstorm, and each crack of thunder sent a chill down my spine.",we are in the storm ,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The song's lyrics 'we are in the storm' minimally align with the emotional intensity and concern expressed in the prompt about a friend driving through a thunderstorm. The emotional alignment is somewhat present as it mentions the storm, which is the setting of the user's worry. However, the lyrics are too brief and vague to fully capture the depth of concern and fear for the friend's safety, resulting in a low score in contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is also low due to the lack of detail and development in the text, making it difficult to grasp any substantial meaning or narrative."
"I came home after a long day to find my partner had cleaned up and cooked dinner, and it made me realize how lucky I am to have them.",i woke up today i strapped my shoes on tight it s gonna be a long day i won t be home till tonight i m going out to the lake to see what i can bring in if anybody needs me tell them i ve gone fishing it seems like yesterday was lost but now i m found i ve got a great job that pays to spread god s joy around many have been lead astray i ll tell them what they ve been missing jesus is the only way and that s why i ve gone fishing i ve gone fishing i ve gone fishing ,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of feeling grateful and lucky for their partner's thoughtful actions. The song's theme revolves around fishing and finding purpose through spirituality, which is unrelated to the user's context of domestic appreciation and partnership. The lyrics themselves are coherent and follow a clear narrative about fishing and spreading joy, which is why it scores higher on lyrical coherence. However, due to the lack of emotional and contextual relevance, the overall effectiveness of this song as a therapeutic match for the user's prompt is very low."
"I just found my grandmother’s favorite shawl tucked in her chair, and tears welled up as I remembered her warmth.",there s a blanket of snow covering up the old road to the house where i was raised through the window i see the lights on the tree and a glow from the old fireplace though it all looks the same so much as changed from the way it used to be christmas memories of happy years gone by they come back to me and keep me warm inside still those memories make me cry now the stockings are filled the old house is still and the kids are all dreaming away there s that old easy chair me and daddy sat there waiting for santa s sleigh now daddy has gone but we ll carry on cause the little ones still need christmas memories of happy years gone by they come back to me and keep me warm inside still those christmas memories oh they mean so much to me oh those christmas memories make me cry,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong emotional alignment with the user's prompt, as both deal with nostalgia and the emotional warmth associated with memories of loved ones. The mention of a blanket, warmth, and tears aligns well with the user's emotional state upon finding their grandmother's shawl. Contextually, the song fits as it revolves around memories tied to a specific place and the feelings these memories evoke, similar to the user's experience with the shawl. However, the song's focus on Christmas slightly diverges from the general theme of remembering a loved one, which is not specifically tied to a holiday in the user's prompt. The lyrics are coherent, telling a clear story of past family experiences and the emotional impact of those memories, which enhances the listener's understanding and emotional connection."
"I opened my inbox this morning to find I’d received my scholarship award, and I can’t stop grinning from ear to ear.",i think i saw ol santa through my window christmas eve my eyes were really droopy but i really do believe it must ve been ol santa cause i saw his big red hat and i know my mom and dad can t fly like that oh no and then i heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door the same ol christmas trick my dad had played since i was four he stands outside my bedroom yelling ho ho ho because he knows i don t believe in santa claus no way i think my daddy sees me peeking from my door but he pretends he s santa anyway every year he tries to fool me but i m a big boy now i don t believe in santa or his sleigh no way so i went back to my bed and i curled up nice and tight i stared out of my window and i looked into the night and then all of a sudden through my window i could see santa claus was flying by and smiling at me santa claus santa claus it must ve been ol santa claus santa claus santa claus happy ho ho ho to you and then i heard ol rudolph tellin me to come outside he told me that ol santa wanted me to take a ride i climbed out of my window and i jumped onto his sleigh and then ol santa took me up and away  we flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below i saw my big red school house and the town square picture show it was really past my bedtime and so ol santa said little boys like you should be in bed so i hollered ho ho ho and i put on santa s hat then he let me hold the reins a while we pulled up to my window and i jumped back in my room and i waved goodbye to santa with a smile when i woke up christmas morning well it was clear and bright my parents said my window had blown open in the night i smiled as i told them that it must ve been the cat and they asked me where i got my big red hat yeah yeah c mon santa claus santa claus it must ve been ol santa claus santa claus santa claus happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you one more again,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song, which revolves around a Christmas theme and a child's interaction with Santa Claus, does not align with the user's emotional state of joy and achievement related to receiving a scholarship award. The emotional alignment and contextual relevance scores are both zero because the song's theme of childhood Christmas fantasy does not match the user's situation of academic achievement and personal success. However, the song's lyrics are somewhat coherent and tell a clear, albeit unrelated, story, which warrants a coherence score of 3. Overall, the song is not a suitable match for the user's current emotional and contextual state."
"I woke up this morning to find a bouquet of flowers on my nightstand with a note that said ‘just because’, and my heart melted.",at this point in my life clearly i can see all the gifts he bestowed upon me that is why deep inside i have this joy there was once a time my soul was searching to find a place to nest now in this joy i can rest now my heart holds the love he has given me and that s all that i ll ever need to live believe and spread his love i m so glad i have this joy,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a deep sense of joy and gratitude, which aligns well with the user's emotional state of feeling touched and loved upon receiving the flowers. However, the song's context seems to focus more on spiritual or divine love and gratitude, rather than a romantic or personal gesture like the one described in the prompt. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, though they lean towards a more abstract and repetitive expression of feelings rather than a clear narrative or detailed expression."
"I just sat down to record my podcast and realized I hadn’t rehearsed my opening lines, and I felt my palms grow clammy.",and i have grown i have could ve sworn i have for long i was certain that i saw it clear i am you then your sweaty palms surround it and i have grown i have could ve sworn i had but i forgot that i ever really was here heaving with all my might hear the lightning through the sky heaving with all my might hear the lightning through this for long i was certain that i saw it clear i am you than your sweaty palms surrounded but i forgot that i was ever really was here ,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The emotional alignment of the song with the user's prompt is somewhat present, as the mention of 'sweaty palms' directly correlates with the user's experience of clamminess. However, the overall theme of the song seems to diverge significantly from the specific scenario of preparing for a podcast, which affects its contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are quite disjointed and repetitive, lacking clear structure or narrative, which makes the lyrical coherence quite low. Overall, while there is a slight emotional connection, the song does not effectively match the user's context and is difficult to follow lyrically."
I just watched the sunrise break through the clouds and felt sure today would bring new opportunities.,yeah just when i had the money to spend and i was always thinking it would never end then the time came to the end of the game don t you know and just when the sky got shiny and bright there never seemed to be an end of the light but then the clouds came it started to rain don t you know just when it was going just when it was going so good just when it just when it was going so good but just when the highway straightened out for a mile and i was thinking i d just cruise for a while a fork in the road bought a new episode don t you know baby don t you worry i said baby don t you cry we re going to get it together and i know you re asking why yeah just when baby,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of change and unexpected turns, which aligns somewhat with the theme of new opportunities as mentioned in the user's prompt. However, the song primarily focuses on the end of good times and the onset of challenges ('then the clouds came it started to rain'), which contrasts with the optimistic tone of the prompt about a hopeful new day. Contextually, the song does not specifically mention a sunrise or a similar setting, making it less relevant. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear progression, affecting their coherence."
I just saw my project showcased in the company newsletter and couldn’t help but beam at what I’d accomplished.,i am a very important person i ve acquired a genetically altered handshake capable of speeds up to thirty miles an hour hair arranged by the most advanced landscape surveillance operators our company can afford i have a very expensive pen i use big words quite often in substitution for semantically equivalent words i attribute this success to my professional demeanor and my strong stock portfolio though it may not appear so i am quite comfortable in my surroundings i have everything let me show you around smile you fucker it s not often you get this chance love is just an exchange of corporate documents i ve reviewed your rapport and i feel you re a prospect for mechanical salvation this is a joint venture that will be mutually advantageous to both parties involved technically this is just a business merger a consolidation of liquid assets we are respectively geared towards customer service there is a great possibility for corporate sponsorship if you re willing i am sure we could synchronize agendas swift and efficient satisfaction oh satisfaction baby oh come on through innovative planning we could form a strong strategic partnership capable of overcoming sensitive and adverse predicaments which will be discussed at the next goals assessment meeting promotion possibility and additional benefits are diagrammed in my preliminary objective outline raises are granted based on performance,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics chosen have a corporate and professional theme, which aligns somewhat with the user's experience of having their project featured in a company newsletter. However, the emotional tone of the song is sarcastic and critical of corporate culture, which does not match the user's positive and proud emotions. The lyrics are coherent in their own context but may seem disjointed and overly satirical for someone celebrating a personal achievement. Overall, the song does not effectively resonate with the user's feelings of accomplishment and pride."
"I just found an old photo of my childhood home tucked away in a drawer, and it made me realize how far I’ve come.",there s an old kodak camera in my dresser drawer i ran across it just this afternoon and i realized that i don t ever use it anymore in fact last time i did i think it was with you when we were down in cozumel we had the whole beach to ourselves and it s crazy now to think that it s all there on that film and i could take it to the store to be developed but what for i can still see everything just fine and who needs pictures with a memory like mine standing there i couldn t help but think about everything that might be on that roll i think it even has another trip we took i guess that must ve been at least three years ago when we were down in baton rouge and there wasn t much to do so we drove into new orleans every afternoon and i swear that you would think that it was only yesterday cause i can still see everything just fine who needs pictures with a memory like mine somewhere in my closet there s a cardboard box just sitting on a shelf it s full of faded memories and it s been there ever since the night you left oh just forgotten photographs to remind me of the past oh but i can still see everything just fine who needs pictures with a memory like mine yeah who needs pictures with a memory like mine,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,"The song lyrics resonate strongly with the user's prompt about reminiscing over an old photo of their childhood home. The emotional alignment scores a 4 as the song captures the nostalgic and reflective mood evoked by finding an old photograph, though it focuses more on past relationships rather than personal growth. The contextual relevance is excellent, scoring a 5, as the song directly discusses old photographs and memories, perfectly fitting the theme of looking back at the past. The lyrical coherence is good, scoring a 4, as the lyrics are clear and tell a coherent story about reminiscing through old photos, though the narrative about specific past events might slightly divert from the user's context of personal growth. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's emotional and contextual prompt, effectively capturing the essence of nostalgia and reflection triggered by an old photograph."
"I just got the call that my test results came back clear, and I felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders.",let me down now i m falling off the line and i can feel it crawling through my spine because in my room now i feel so divine not a worry running through my mind,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics chosen reflect a significant emotional shift, which aligns well with the user's feeling of relief and lightness after receiving good news about their test results. The mention of feeling 'so divine' and having 'not a worry running through my mind' resonates with the user's emotional state of relief and happiness. However, the lyrics about 'falling off the line' and feeling something 'crawling through my spine' might not perfectly fit the context of receiving good health news, as they could imply a sense of unease or discomfort, which slightly detracts from the contextual relevance. The lyrics are coherent and create a clear image of emotional transformation, which supports the user's experience."
I just reread the harsh message I sent my friend last night and felt a deep regret for how I spoke.,well i m sorry that you lost your shit and that s all i ve got to say about it tonight i ve thought you told me you never screamed out loud and you re proud of porno queen yes proud oh got out of bed regan it s all in your little head,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
"I just sat down for dinner and saw my father’s chair still empty, my heart ached and I can’t stop crying.",from my body out my eyes leaving my insides like the bed of ache forgotten was the story was the language never to breathe again or so it seems the surface of the earth felt like a fable after she drank up all the sea bury my father out in a church yard i have no one left to remember my name,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"The recommended song lyrics strongly align with the emotional intensity and grief expressed in the user's prompt. The mention of 'bury my father out in a church yard' directly connects to the user's experience of missing their father, scoring high on emotional alignment. The context of loss and remembrance is relevant, though the abstract and somewhat disjointed nature of the lyrics might slightly detract from the contextual relevance, as they could be seen as overly metaphorical compared to the straightforward emotional pain in the prompt. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are evocative and poetic but might be challenging to follow due to their fragmented and symbolic style, which could affect the listener's ability to fully engage with the song's narrative."
"I just discovered a heartfelt letter from my childhood friend tucked inside an old book, and I was completely caught off guard.",this is the letter that i wrote before see in those words i wrote i had no fear yeah i was about 10 years old and uh it was christmas day i remember waking up looking at myself and thinking how amazing it is to be what an amazing feel that is but you do forget you know this is what i m coming for more ,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song's emotional alignment scores a 3 as it captures a sense of nostalgia and reflection, which aligns with the user's experience of discovering an old letter. However, the context of the song, which seems to focus on a childhood Christmas memory, only partially matches the user's context of finding a letter, earning a score of 2. The lyrical coherence of the song is low, scoring a 1, due to disjointed phrases and a lack of clear narrative flow, making it difficult to fully grasp the intended message or emotion. Overall, the song partially matches the user's emotional and contextual prompt but is hindered by its lyrical incoherence."
