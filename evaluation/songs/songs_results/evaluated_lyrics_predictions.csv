Watching my teammate stay late to coach the interns after hours left me genuinely inspired.,they had been listening to our music and was inspired by what we did and just the fact that ya know big pun was covering it and getting at me to be in the video it made me feel good like a legend before my times they did that like nobody else could do that cause that was one of those classic records that was like if you touch it you gotta really know what you doing or you really mess up the ingredients and they touched it and really put they own ingredients on it to make it sound real smooth,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics discuss the inspiration derived from music and the respect for someone's contribution to a classic record, which only slightly aligns with the user's emotional state of feeling inspired. However, the context of the song, which revolves around music and legacy, does not closely match the user's situation of witnessing a teammate's dedication and mentorship. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear, structured narrative, making them moderately difficult to follow. Overall, the song does not effectively capture the specific emotional and contextual nuances of the user's experience."
That clip of a golden retriever chasing bubbles still has me giggling at my desk.,get back get back get back get back get back hey you why why i laugh ,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics have a very loose connection to the user's prompt. The emotional alignment scores a 2 because the repetition of 'get back' and the phrase 'why why i laugh' could vaguely relate to the playful and humorous nature of a dog chasing bubbles. However, it lacks a direct reflection of joy or amusement. The contextual relevance is low, scoring a 1, as the lyrics do not specifically address or evoke imagery of dogs, bubbles, or a lighthearted scene. The lyrical coherence is also low, scoring a 1, due to the disjointed and repetitive nature of the lyrics, which do not form a clear or fluent narrative. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual prompt."
The courier dumped my brand-new keyboard in a puddle and walked off—I'm fuming.,youre the one that made me have to walk away you tried to compromise and make me change my ways you left me cold and ive got nothing more to say you left me dry and ive got nothing more to say1,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a strong sense of frustration and abandonment, aligning well with the user's emotional state of being 'fuming'. However, the context of the song seems to revolve around a personal or emotional betrayal rather than a specific incident involving negligence or carelessness, which is the context of the user's prompt. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and simplistic but maintain a coherent message of feeling left alone and disappointed, which resonates with the user's experience of being let down."
The elevator keeps dinging on every floor even when nobody’s inside; it’s testing my patience.,waiting to put my feet on the ground i m tired of going up and down but sometimes it feels safer waiting it s beautiful at the top but i never really get a chance to stop it feels like i am falling again doors are opening doors are closing people come and go but i m still riding elevators never here or there on the ground or in the air people come and go but i m still riding elevators everyone seems to have somewhere to go i dream of going with them but i don t i m looking down always on every floor but i never really find what i m looking for but i keep looking for you doors are opening doors are closing people come and go but i m still riding elevators never here or there on the ground or in the air people come and go but i m still riding elevators if i get off and i could get lost or better if you were there i wouldn t have to keep riding elevators doors are opening doors are closing people come and go but i m still riding elevators never here or there on the ground or in the air people come and go but i m still riding elevators never here or there on the ground or in the air people come and go but i m still riding elevators,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
My colleague refactored the legacy code and now it runs twice as fast—exactly what we needed.,we have the technology we have the technology1,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The song's repeated phrase 'we have the technology' loosely aligns with the theme of technological improvement or enhancement, which is somewhat relevant to the context of refactoring code to improve performance. However, the emotional alignment is weak as the lyrics do not convey any specific emotions related to the success or satisfaction that might be felt after such an achievement. The lyrical coherence is low due to the repetitive and minimalistic nature of the lyrics, which do not provide a clear narrative or detailed expression."
"Let me know the moment you get home so I can relax, please.",do you want me to go i ll drive home it s alright hold the thought so tightly it was just a passing thing come inside have a seat i ll be with you soon you don t seem to have feeling turn the lights off when you leave,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song's emotional alignment scores a 2 as it touches slightly on themes of waiting and concern, which aligns somewhat with the user's need for reassurance upon someone's safe arrival. However, the emotional intensity and specific context of relaxation once the person is home are not strongly reflected. The contextual relevance is low, scoring a 1, because the song's narrative about someone possibly leaving and the request to turn off the lights does not closely match the user's scenario of waiting for someone to get home to feel relaxed. The lyrical coherence scores a 2, as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear, fluent narrative, making it harder to grasp a coherent message that aligns well with the user's prompt."
Why does this site have three different checkout buttons?

The emotional alignment scores low as the song's playful tone contrasts sharply with the user's likely frustration or confusion. Contextually, the song is irrelevant to the user's issue related to website navigation and usability. The lyrical coherence is also low, as the lyrics are repetitive and lack a clear, logical flow, though they maintain a basic structure of question and answer. Overall, the song does not effectively address or resonate with the user's expressed feelings and situation."
I can’t stop wondering what the northern lights look like in person.,if i could take a look through picture frames and books i wonder what it is i d see cities lights and sunsets faces i dont know yet think of what the time can bring run like rivers chasing dreams i kiss you in the city streets see young hwart with a brand new point of view when we grow old well turn the pages take a look back down through the ages it was bright all this life i lived with you if i could take a look through picture frames and books i wonder what it is i d see,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics express a sense of wonder and curiosity, which aligns somewhat with the user's emotional state of wondering about the northern lights. However, the song primarily focuses on reminiscing about life experiences and relationships rather than the awe of natural phenomena, which makes its contextual relevance low. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack clarity in conveying a specific message, leading to a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
It's only Tuesday and I'm already day-dreaming about sinking into a hammock by the sea in my weekend.,so here i go i ll dive right in break through the waves straight to the ocean floor and although my hands are shaking i lie perfectly still cause i m determined to let myself sink down and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again i could wave my arms and swim away but never reach the shore but for now i will lay face first in the sand with the wreckage from ships that lost their way and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again and although my hands are shaking i lie perfectly still cause i m determined to let myself sink down and i know i m buried too far down to feel the warmth from the sun again,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
Spent a week on that proposal and it didn’t even make the meeting agenda—ouch.,not submitted,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Since no song lyrics were submitted, it is impossible to evaluate the emotional alignment, contextual relevance, or lyrical coherence in relation to the user's prompt."
My teammate keeps blaring voice notes on speaker in the open office; I swear earbuds were invented for a reason.,maybe there are cartwheels in your mouth maybe your words will grow up to be a gymnasts maybe you have been kicking people with them by accident i know some people get a whole lot of rocking in the rocking chair and the ones who dont sometimes get rocks in their voice boxes and their voice boxes become slingshots maybe you think my heart looks like a baby squirrel but you absolutely missed when you told the class i have head lice cause i one hundred percent absolutely do not have head lice and even if i do it is a fact that head lice prefer clean heads over dirty ones so i am clean as a whistle on a tea pot my mother says it is totally fine if i blow off steam as long as i speak in an octave my kindness can still reach my kindness knows mermaids never ever miss their legs in the water cause there are better ways to move through the ocean than kicking so guess what if i ever have my own team i am picking everyone first even the worst kid and the kid with the stutter like a skipping record cause i know all of us are scratched even if you cant hear it when we speak my mother says most people have heartbeats that are knocking on doors that will never open and i know my heart is a broken freezer chest cause i can never keep anything frozen so no i am not always crying i am just thawing outside of the lines and even if i am always crying it is a fact that salt is the only reason everything floats so good in the dead sea and just cause no one ever passes notes to me doesnt mean i am not super duper in fact my super duper might be a buoy or a paper boat the next time your nose gets stuck up the river cause it is a fact that our hearts stop every for a milli second every time we sneeze and some peoples houses have too much dust some peoples fathers are like attics ive heard attics have monsters in their walls and shaky stares i think if i lived in a house with attic id nightmare a burglar in my safety chest and maybe id look for rest in the sticks and stones cause my mother says a person can only swallow so much punch before hes drunk on his own fist but the only drunk i ever knew was sleeping in the alley behind our church and jesus turned water into his wine so even god has his bad days but on your bad days couldnt you just say hey im having a bad day instead of telling me im stupid or poor or telling me i dress like a boy cause maybe i am a boy and a girl maybe my name is andrea andrew so what it is a fact that bumblebees have hair on their eyes and humans also should comb though everything they see like an anchorman is not a sailor like the clouds might be a pillow fight like my mother says every bird perched on a telephone wire will listen to the conversations running through its feet to decide the direction of its flight so i know every word we speak can make hurricanes in peoples weather veins or shine their shiny shine so maybe sometime you could sit beside me on the bus and i could say guess what it is a fact that manatees have vocal chords but do not have ears and beethoven made music even when he could no longer hear and i know every belt that has hit someones back is still a belt that was built to hold something up and it is fact that egyptians slept on pillows made of stone but its not hard for me to dream that maybe one day youll write me back like the day i wrote the lightening bug to say i smashed my mason jar and i threw away the lid i didnt want to take a chance that id grow up to be a war i want to be a belly dance or an accordion or a pogo stick or the fingerprints the mason left in the mortar between the bricks to prove that he was here that he built a roof over someones head to keep the storm from their faith my mother says thats why we all were born and i think shes right so write back soon sincerely yours 1,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The recommended song lyrics are abstract and poetic, touching on themes of communication, misunderstanding, and personal expression. However, they do not align well with the user's specific emotional frustration about a teammate's disruptive behavior in an office setting. The context of the song, which seems to deal more with personal identity and emotional resilience, does not directly address the office environment or the issue with using speakerphones inappropriately. The lyrics, while creative and expressive, are somewhat disjointed and may be difficult to follow, which affects their coherence in relation to the user's straightforward complaint about workplace etiquette."
Opened the fridge and the sour-milk smell nearly knocked me over.,i woke up covered in sand it s not so ugly now i ve seen its face oh i can hear it breathing it bites my thumb i throw it at the wall i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm it didn t take too long only bout an hour in the coals we all sat down to eat it the meal was burnt i cut my gums on bone i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm and as blue as my back  i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm and the moon was the size of my hand,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The recommended song lyrics have a surreal and somewhat disturbing quality that loosely connects to the discomfort implied in the user's prompt about the sour-milk smell. However, the emotional alignment is weak as the song's narrative and tone diverge significantly from the simple disgust or annoyance typically associated with a bad smell. Contextually, the song's mention of 'coughed out milk' is the only direct link to the user's experience with sour milk, but it's embedded in a broader, unrelated narrative that doesn't enhance understanding or resonance with the initial scenario. The lyrics themselves are disjointed and abstract, making lyrical coherence low as they lack a clear, understandable narrative or message."
"I started presenting, then realized the slide on screen was upside down—facepalm moment.",i tell you there are no big shots in reality y all we re all in the same boat dealing with the same issues same problems same stuff don t even buy it all the perpetration you know all this we don t have problems that s a lie that s a lie i know that the enemy is doing the same thing to me that he s doing to everybody else i just know now that the only way to get out is through confrontation see we always thought it was retreat you know run away and i m telling you you got to confront it this is a strange song because this song when this song was written this is when everything sort of stopped it was written a long time ago but it was right before god just snatched me out of everything and because i didn t understand initially it was written i d written it about the whole amadou diallo situation when it first happened and i went to the studio and i laid it down and it was like strong for the first day and then it just regressed everyday after that and i said what s going on what s happening and at the end of it there was a word that i used rebel and i guess was afraid it was such a hot time in the city at that point i was afraid that if i put the record out people would misunderstand what i meant by rebel and they d just take it to the streets so i was very intimidated and afraid and before i knew it a whole host of things happened everything stopped after that and the creativity stopped everything stopped that s when i realized i had to understand what i was talking about before i could tell somebody else what i was talking about and i had to be you know a living example it s real crazy because i don t know what the press is saying because i don t listen to the press too much but i know the view is that i m emotionally unstable which is reality like you aren t i m laughing because what i ve realized i ve become is one of those mad scientists who does the tests on themselves first you see to make sure that they work and that s when you know ok look i got something that works you know what i m saying i m not gonna give you something that i haven t tested for myself and you go through and you re learning by way of experience and you re making mistakes and you re getting up a friend of mine once said to me he said look if we weren t supposed to turn around why does a car have a steering wheel are we just supposed to crash into the wall no we re supposed to say listen i was going the wrong way reverse in this particular song now i realize that this song is about freedom you see we could look at one human being but it s about the spirit of freedom being taken out and how it s taken out in all of us the song is called i find it hard to say bear with me a little bit,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's prompt about a humorous and slightly embarrassing situation of presenting with an upside-down slide. The song's themes of confrontation, personal growth, and societal issues are far removed from the light-hearted, facepalm moment described. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and difficult to follow, which affects their coherence. Overall, the song fails to capture the simplicity and humor of the user's situation, making it a poor match both emotionally and contextually."

However, the song's primary theme of a spiritual journey on the 'J train' diverges significantly from the sports-related excitement and anticipation described by the user. The lyrics, while energetic and enthusiastic, focus more on a spiritual ride and redemption rather than a physical or sports-related journey, leading to a lower score in contextual relevance. Additionally, the lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are repetitive and somewhat disjointed, which might make it harder for the user to find a clear, relatable narrative in the context of their current excitement about the semifinal game."
Someone knocked on the door at midnight and then went silent; my heart’s racing.,i ve been waiting for some time cause tonight she is mine yeah i called her on the phone what she said turned me on she said no boys til midnight so i walked to her house just to see what she s about when i knocked on her door i heard her say once more she said no boys till midnight she said no boys til midnight no boys til midnight no boys til midnight she said no boys til midnight she said no boys til midnight she said no boys no boys no boys,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional and contextual prompt. The user's prompt suggests a feeling of suspense and anxiety due to an unexpected event at midnight, whereas the song is about anticipation and excitement related to a romantic encounter scheduled at midnight. The emotional tone of fear or anxiety in the prompt is not reflected in the song's theme of romantic excitement. Contextually, the song's narrative about waiting for a romantic encounter does not match the mysterious and possibly frightening scenario described in the prompt. The lyrics of the song are somewhat repetitive and lack depth, but they maintain a basic coherence in expressing the central theme of waiting for a romantic moment, hence the score for lyrical coherence."
Got home drenched from the rain and found a thermos of hot tea waiting on my desk—little gestures like that rescue a day.,jai bu un th i drank some tea taqqalahi tisnant alshash ere s taqqal sallul asraf eswegh atay ihan elkas azzar s ulhin har tisantas tennedahi ham wer djennegh fel nammoqqas hamti d sektugh ere s taqqal sallul asraf ed es nedjet nammos aslaf tamat tidagh dagh dassidjegh wer asbakegh wer aqqimagh akfor ahar abrur edjar muchan arne berin labkhar,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not align with the user's emotional experience of finding comfort in a small, thoughtful gesture like a thermos of hot tea after being drenched in the rain. The lyrics appear to be in a different language and are not coherent or understandable in the context of the prompt. There is no clear emotional or thematic connection to the user's experience, and the lyrics do not convey a sense of warmth, comfort, or appreciation that matches the user's sentiment."
"Every corner of the house still echoes dad’s jokes, and he’s not here anymore.",the only thing that was in the way was not clear please show and everything they said we couldnt be i shed my fear you know go home go home back to where you used to be missed jokes shadows fill the air in between the city is so bright you can see things have changed so mad and everyone you know can only be prearranged so sad go home go home back to where you used to be missed jokes shadows fill the air in between today in this world my voice is gone washed away returning home doesnt feel all the same when memories are all we have when all we have is in our heads,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song captures the emotional essence of missing someone who used to fill the home with laughter ('missed jokes shadows fill the air'), aligning well with the user's sentiment of missing their dad's presence. Contextually, the song's theme of returning to a place that no longer feels the same due to the absence of a loved one resonates with the user's situation. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat lacking; the lyrics are disjointed and difficult to follow, which might detract from the overall emotional and contextual impact."
The scholarship acceptance email just landed—I’m practically floating.,i just got an invitation through the mails your presence requested this evening it s formal a top hat a white tie and tails nothing now could take the wind out of my sails because i m invited to step out this evening with top hat white tie and tails i m puttin on my top hat tyin up my white tie brushin off my tails i m dudein up my shirt front puttin in the shirt studs polishin my nails i m steppin out my dear to breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class and i trust that you ll excuse my dust when i step on the gas for i ll be there puttin down my top hat mussin up my white tie dancin in my tails,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics convey a sense of excitement and celebration, aligning well with the user's emotion of feeling elated about receiving a scholarship acceptance. The mention of receiving an 'invitation' and preparing for a formal event mirrors the user's experience of receiving an important email. However, the context of a formal dance or party in the song is not a perfect match for the academic achievement context of the scholarship acceptance, leading to a slightly lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are coherent and flow well, though the old-fashioned style and vocabulary might slightly reduce clarity for some listeners."
"She slipped a note into my lunchbox that read “you’ve got this,” and my chest warmed.",she gettin it,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
Waiting outside the exam hall; my notes suddenly look like hieroglyphs.,like notches carved in bones like pictographic stones in fragments and on cliffs i read your hieroglyphs black tablet and gold seal my future you reveal inscriptions left in tunes in alleys and in ruins like notches carved in bones like pictographic stones in fragments and on cliffs i read your hieroglyphs memoranda memoranda memoranda memoranda,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.33,"The song's repeated references to 'hieroglyphs' align somewhat with the user's description of their notes looking like hieroglyphs, which scores moderately on contextual relevance. However, the emotional alignment is low because the song does not capture the specific anxiety or nervousness of waiting outside an exam hall. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and abstract, lacking a clear narrative or emotional progression, which affects their coherence. Overall, while there is a thematic connection through the imagery of 'hieroglyphs,' the song does not effectively address the user's emotional state or provide a coherent lyrical narrative."
The sky finally cleared after days of rain—feels like good things are coming.,i can see clearly now the rain has gone i can see all obstacles in my way gone are the dark clouds that had me blind it s going to be a bright bright sunshiny day it s going to be a bright bright sunshiny day i think i can make it now the pain has gone and all of the bad feelings have disappeared here is the rainbow i ve been praying for it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day look all around there s nothing but blue skies look straight ahead nothing but blue skies i think i can make it now the pain has gone and all of the bad feelings have disappeared i can see clearly now the rain has gone it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"The recommended song 'I Can See Clearly Now' by Johnny Nash aligns perfectly with the user's emotional state of optimism and relief following a period of rain. The lyrics directly reference the clearing of rain and the emergence of a 'bright, sunshiny day,' which mirrors the user's sentiment about good things coming after days of rain. The lyrics are coherent, with a clear and fluent expression of overcoming obstacles and seeing a positive future, enhancing both the emotional and contextual relevance of the song to the user's prompt."
Saw my app featured on the store’s front page—cheeks hurt from smiling.,i stopped off at the grocery store to pick up a few things and i was reaching for some cheerios when i heard someone say my name i knew exactly who it was my heart started to race i turned around my legs got weak when i saw her face there stood the girl that broke my heart just a year ago i thought that i was over her but little did i know that running into her like that would leave me in a total mess wishing that we never said goodbye and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she ran over and hugged my neck i didn t want her to let go she smiled and said i looked just like a kid with my box of cheerios we laughed and talked about old times which wasn t all that smart cause it just left me with an emptiness when she pushed away her cart and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she walked away looked back and smiled clean up on aisle five,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,"The song's emotional tone, which revolves around nostalgia and heartbreak, does not align well with the user's emotion of joy and pride from seeing their app featured. The context of the song, set in a grocery store with a chance encounter, also does not match the user's context of a professional achievement. However, the lyrics themselves are coherent and tell a clear, if unrelated, story. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual prompt."
Spent half an hour cursing the remote control until I realised I was pointing it at the wrong TV box—light-bulb moment.,i know i can never make up my mind half the time im sick just tryna find a straight light and i thought i saw the light behind your glassy narrow eyes fall fell and the weight came crashing down half the year i spent trying to relieve myself and i thought your hands were warmth something to fix my freezing form but i soon realized again it was just poor circulation and i thought i saw the light behind your glassy narrow eyes but i soon found it to be brewin slowly inside of me,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of frustration and realization, which aligns to some extent with the user's experience of confusion and eventual realization. However, the emotional tone of the song is more intense and introspective than the light-hearted frustration described in the prompt. Contextually, the song does not directly relate to the scenario of dealing with technology or having a 'light-bulb' moment in a humorous or mundane situation. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but tend to be abstract and disjointed, making it difficult to grasp a clear narrative or connection to the user's specific scenario."
The vet said the tests are normal—I can finally breathe again.,finally i feel calm anxiety disappeared there s no pain at all finally it went away there is no regret i know i understand i can breathe a sigh of relief i accept the end of my closed reality i need a sky innocent sky i feel like i left my shell behind the room full of light is tidied up i drew back the curtains and removed all my doubts i need a sky my moonlight and my sunset drawn with a trusting childlike smile,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The song's lyrics align exceptionally well with the emotional relief described in the user's prompt. The mention of calmness, the disappearance of anxiety, and the ability to 'breathe a sigh of relief' directly mirror the user's feelings of relief upon receiving good news from the vet. Contextually, the song fits well as it discusses a transition from a state of worry to one of relief and acceptance, though it doesn't specifically mention pets or veterinary contexts, hence the slightly lower score. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express a journey from darkness to light, though some metaphors about 'sky' and 'moonlight' might slightly divert from the direct context of the user's situation, impacting the coherence score slightly."
"I laughed at his idea during the meeting, and guilt’s eating at me now.",i keep on laughing and you re keeping track and tonight i ll go back to the place i first knew that i d wait for you always on streets and in doorways where engines they die near the northeastern line and you mentioned a record that reminded me of a week that you couldn t get things out of your head i m truly sorry i missed that night it could have been the best time but it s just timing she showed up unexpected and i the train into town i put my collar down and pushed through the door but if it s smiles you want talk to the kid with the boy eyes and wake up dreaming next to him,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song's lyrics touch on themes of regret and missed opportunities, which aligns to some extent with the user's feelings of guilt. However, the song's narrative about missed connections and reminiscing about past interactions does not directly address the specific scenario of feeling guilty about laughing at someone's idea. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and difficult to follow, reducing their coherence and making it harder to draw a clear connection to the user's context of a meeting and the subsequent guilt. Overall, while there are elements of regret that match the user's emotional state, the song does not effectively capture the specific context or maintain lyrical clarity."
The empty seat at our usual café table made the coffee taste bitter today.,morning coffee tastes like there s no use for me to gettin up again and i dream your lips onto my skin i ve seen many of your future plenty of your past and i walk miles to get through you but your just a bit too fast it s a morning without you without you it s a morning without you and i can t help being greeted for you greeted for more and just an idea of the truth so take down take down all your vanity get lost with me don t you focus on reasons to leave and shakespeare and his breed they were just people like you and me so we make those ghosts disappear and if i say i wanna life for freedom oh i mean that i wanna be caught by you only morning without you i can t stand those mornings without you it s just another morning without you,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,"The song lyrics strongly resonate with the user's emotional state of feeling the absence of someone, which is reflected in the repeated lines about mornings feeling empty without the presence of a loved one. This aligns well with the user's experience of the coffee tasting bitter due to the empty seat, suggesting a shared theme of loneliness and longing. The lyrics are mostly coherent, maintaining a consistent theme throughout, though some metaphoric expressions might slightly obscure the directness of the message. Overall, the song captures the essence of missing someone's presence, making it a suitable match for the user's emotional and contextual needs."
Walked into the living room and everyone yelled “welcome back!”—did not see that coming.,i didn t know you were there until you said hello you had been watching me for i don t know how long i hit my head against the lamp as by surprise i stood up don t be afraid you said it s only me the door wasn t locked the voice i d heard in the hall was hard to recognize but now we know he s on board wearing our disguise if only you and i could trust each other through this then together we could work out who the enemy is,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song partially captures the surprise element of the user's prompt with the mention of being startled ('I hit my head against the lamp as by surprise I stood up'). However, the emotional tone of the song, which hints at suspicion and distrust ('if only you and I could trust each other through this'), does not align well with the presumably joyful and welcoming surprise in the user's scenario. Contextually, the song's theme of distrust and hidden identities diverges significantly from the simple, happy surprise of being welcomed back. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, telling a story of unexpected encounters and hidden truths, but they do not clearly connect to the user's experience of a warm, unexpected welcome."

My cat tried to pounce on its own shadow and face-planted into the rug; still chuckling.,once i laughed when i heard your saying that i d be playing solitaire uneasy in my easy chair it never entered my mind once you told me i was mistaken that i d awaken with the sun and ordered orange juice for one it never entered my mind you have what i laughed myself now i even have to scratch my back myself once you warned me that if you scorned me i d singing the maiden s prayer again and wish that you were there again to get into my hair again it never entered my mind it never entered my mind,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the user's prompt about a humorous and light-hearted incident involving a cat. The emotional alignment is low because the song's tone seems more reflective and somber, focusing on personal loss and regret, which contrasts sharply with the amusement described in the prompt. Contextually, the song does not relate to the specific scenario of a pet or a playful, funny moment. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but may be confusing without a clear narrative or connection to the prompt's theme. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional or contextual needs."
The airline lost my bag for the third time this year and acted like it wasn't a big deal.,so many took me for granted double crossed me for the bag when it landed i m thinkin you not the only fucking plug on this planet i m patient unfamiliar aircraft in sight,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's lyrics partially capture the frustration implied in the user's prompt, particularly through expressions of betrayal and disappointment ('so many took me for granted'). However, the song does not specifically address the context of dealing with an airline or lost luggage, which limits its contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but may be confusing as they jump between themes of betrayal and specific references to aircraft, which only tangentially relate to the user's situation. Overall, the song captures a general sense of frustration but does not specifically align well with the emotional and contextual nuances of the user's experience."

This earns a high score in contextual relevance. The emotional alignment is moderate; while the song captures the annoyance and persistent distraction caused by the dripping tap, it also introduces broader themes about societal and existential concerns that may dilute the specific emotional focus on distraction and irritation intended in the prompt. The lyrical coherence is somewhat lower due to the repetitive and somewhat disjointed nature of the lyrics, which may reflect the distraction theme but also make the song's message less clear and harder to follow."
My roommate finally started rinsing the dishes instead of piling them up—honestly proud of that progress.,yo listen i met this girl on baltic ave you can tell how she steps on boardwalk she was from park place i asked what she was doing on this side of town she said she had some taxes to pay i figured i d take a chance and advance to go and find out more about her cause there s more to know than the ways she sways and the way that she wears her clothes or the way that she plays this game so cold she said she came up rough and the one income household was not enough there d be nights she d go to sleep cold and hungry cause her mom was always short on food and money see people used to joke a lot and tease her bout her clothes not being in style dressed in dingy skirts and dirty sneakers from the finest second hand down on oriental ave but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she s got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly once she graduated jr high she started working overtime scrubbing floors or working on assembly lines just so she could help her mother out and after college they moved into marvin s garden and she got a job working at the city water department to save enough cash to move into community chest condos on pennsylvania ave she fell in love with this dude name ray who was a small time hustler from st charles place and he was known for always being in and out of trouble but the problem was that he was never on her level she argued with her mom about ray s work till he got sent upstate on the same say that she gave birth but see the baby never made it it drove her nearly crazy and she couldn t take it  but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she s got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly listen see where she came from many people find it hard just to hang on you often find them in the same place complaining instead of finding a better way of maintaining she could have balled up and cried and wished that she would die and just gave up on trying instead she grind from the bottom just to make it to the bottom now she s on top and she s flying but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly womanopoly yeah she s got it whoa yeah alright ,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's narrative of overcoming adversity and achieving control over one's life does align somewhat with the theme of making progress and improvement, as mentioned in the user's prompt about their roommate. However, the emotional tone and context of the song, which deals with significant life struggles and societal issues, is much more intense and complex compared to the relatively mundane and light-hearted improvement described in the prompt. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story, but they do not closely match the specific context or lighter emotional tone of the user's situation."
Spent half the night checking on my pup’s fever; I’m dead tired but can’t leave his side.,you know i m tired i got a fevered brow you know i d change if i were with her now you gave me drugs you said d cure my ills they may cure yours but mine are with me still if i were with her now if i were with her now if i were with her now,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's mention of 'tired' and 'fevered brow' aligns well with the user's emotional state of exhaustion and concern over a fever, scoring high in emotional alignment. The context of the song, which seems to revolve around longing and possibly medicinal relief, partially matches the user's situation of caring for a sick pup, thus receiving a moderate score in contextual relevance. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low as the lyrics are repetitive and somewhat disjointed, which might make it harder for the user to find a clear and comforting narrative in the song."
The app keeps saying ‘unknown error’ and I have no clue what’s actually wrong; my brain’s spinning.,there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake i waited in the rain for hours and you were late now it s not like me to say the right thing but you could ve called to let me know i checked your number twice don t understand it so i went home well i d been waiting for this weekend i thought that maybe we could see a show never dreamed i d have this feeling oh but seeing you is believing that s why i don t know why you didn t show up that night oh there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake i was waiting in the rain for hours and you were late since then i ve been running around trying to find you i went to the places that we always go i rang your home but got no answer so i jumped in my car i went round again i still don t believe it he was just leaving oh there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake there must be some misunderstanding there must be some kind of mistake yeah oh there must be oh there must be oh oh misunderstanding oh there must be there must be oh oh misunderstanding oh there must be there must be oh oh misunderstanding oh there must be there must be oh oh misunderstanding,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song 'Misunderstanding' by Genesis captures the frustration and confusion expressed in the user's prompt about an 'unknown error' and their inability to understand the issue, aligning well emotionally. The context of waiting and not receiving an expected response in the song parallels the user's experience with the app's failure and lack of clarity, making it somewhat relevant. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story of disappointment and confusion, which matches the user's feelings. However, the song's scenario of a personal relationship might not perfectly align with the technological context of the user's issue, slightly lowering its contextual score."
Saw a clip of glowing plankton beaches and now I’m itching to know everything about them.,i want to be on an island off the coast of mexico there s an island with tropical sand and boats and humans who light the nighttime sky with fire i wanna colour the sky take a dream with an ember that s dancing itself away from our circle on the beach while we watch bioluminescence make shapes inside the liquid living ocean i wanna swim inside the gulf of mexico1,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,"The song lyrics align well emotionally with the user's sense of wonder and curiosity about glowing plankton, as it conveys a sense of awe and desire to experience natural phenomena. Contextually, the song is highly relevant as it directly mentions bioluminescence and describes a scene on a beach at night which matches the user's prompt about glowing plankton beaches. The lyrics are mostly coherent, with a clear depiction of a beach scene and the desire to experience the bioluminescent ocean, though some lines could be more fluently connected to enhance understanding."
All morning I’ve been day-dreaming about escaping to a quiet cabin in the woods—can almost smell the pine.,lions in the street and roaming dogs in heat rabid foaming a beast caged in the heart of a city the body of his mother rotting in the summer ground he fled the town he went down south and crossed the border left chaos and disorder back there over his shoulder one morning he awoke in a green hotel with a strange creature groaning beside him sweat oozed from its shining skin is everybody in is everybody in is everybody in the ceremony is about to begin wake up you can t remember where it was had this dream stopped the snake was pale gold glazed and shrunken we were afraid to touch it the sheets were hot dead prisms and she was beside me old she s no young her dark red hair the white soft skin now run to the mirror in the bathroom look she s coming in here i can t live through each slow century of her moving i let my cheek slide down the cool smooth tile feel the good cold stinging blood the smooth hissing snakes of rain once i had a little game i liked to crawl back in my brain i think you know the game i mean i mean the game called go insane you should try this little game just close your eyes forget your name forget the world forget the people and we ll erect a different steeple this little game is fun to do just close your eyes no way to lose and i m right there i m going too release control we re breaking through way back deep into the brain back where there s never any pain and the rain falls gently on the town and over the heads of all of us and in the labyrinth of streams beneath the quiet unearthly presence of gentle hill dwellers in the gentle hills around reptiles abounding fossils caves cool air heights each house repeats a mold windows rolled beast car locked in against morning all now sleeping rugs silent mirrors vacant dust lying under the beds of lawful couples wound in sheets and daughters smug with semen eyes in their nipples wait there s been a slaughter here don t stop to speak or look around your gloves and fan are on the ground we re getting out of town we re going on the run and you re the one i want to come not to touch the earth not to see the sun nothing left to do but run run run let s run let s run house upon the hill moon is lying still shadows of the trees witnessing the wild breeze c mon baby run with me let s run run with me run with me run with me let s run the mansion is warm at the top of the hill rich are the rooms and the comforts there red are the arms of luxuriant chairs and you won t know a thing till you get inside dead president s corpse in the driver s car the engine runs on glue and tar c mon along we re not going very far to the east to meet the czar run with me run with me run with me let s run some outlaws lived by the side of the lake the minister s daughter s in love with the snake who lives in a well by the side of the road wake up girl we re almost home we should see the gates by mornin we should be inside by evening sun sun sun burn burn burn burn burn burn i will get you soon soon soon i am the lizard king i can do anything we came down the rivers and highways we came down from forests and falls we came down from carson and springfield we came down from phoenix enthralled and i can tell you the names of the kingdom i can tell you the things that you know listening for a fistful of silence climbing valleys into the shade for seven years i dwelt in the loose palace of exile playing strange games with the girls of the island now i have come again to the land of the fair and the strong and the wise brothers and sisters of the pale forest children of night who among you will run with the hunt now night arrives with her purple legion retire now to your tents and to your dreams tomorrow we enter the town of my birth i want to be ready3,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not align with the user's emotional or contextual prompt. The user's prompt suggests a peaceful, serene daydream about escaping to a quiet cabin in the woods, evoking a sense of tranquility and nature. However, the song lyrics are chaotic, intense, and filled with imagery of beasts, disorder, and escape from turmoil, which contrasts sharply with the calm and restful scenario described by the user. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and difficult to follow, lacking coherence and a clear narrative flow, which makes it challenging to derive a clear meaning or emotional resonance related to the user's daydream."
"Practised for weeks, but the open-mic night was cancelled at the last minute—total letdown.",one night only is not enough,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's lyrics 'one night only is not enough' partially capture the disappointment of the user's situation, reflecting the emotional letdown of an anticipated event being cancelled. However, the lyrics do not fully align with the specific scenario of practicing for an event that was then cancelled, thus the low score in contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are coherent but very brief and lack depth, which limits a full understanding or connection to the user's specific experience."
Can’t stand how people leave popcorn and cups all over the cinema floor after a movie; it really bothers me.,it took you long not to see it took me on not too see you next to me cause you re too hard to read just took a hit of ecstasy the room is spinning all around me but you re still next to to me so why else could you want to leave you said you needed to get going so you came home with me we made a bit of light love we figured we d figure it out in the morning so we ate breakfast early walking out the door is so dishonourable and sleeping on the floor is so fucking uncomfortable and a few months passed by we ran into each other at the movies and avoided eye contact you got some popcorn i got myself a berry smoothie and we entered separately but then when i sat down you were sitting right beside me and i couldn t concentrate so i said a little hey love and you continued to ignore me so i just watched the movie piranha in 3d disappointed me you re sleeping on my arm i ll cut off my numb arm but i don t have a knife so i ll gnaw off my numb arm you re sleeping on my arm i ll saw off my numb arm how did we get here these are my drunk eyes,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.3,"The song's emotional tone of confusion and frustration somewhat aligns with the user's annoyance about the cinema mess, but it's a weak connection, scoring a 1 for emotional alignment. Contextually, the song mentions a cinema setting and popcorn, which directly relates to the user's prompt, earning a 2. However, the song's lyrics are disjointed and difficult to follow, leading to a coherence score of 1. The overall score is low due to the lack of strong alignment with the user's emotions and the poor lyrical coherence."
Stepped into the elevator and the stench of stale sweat hit me so hard it made my stomach flip.,every day i wake up feeling this way i take it downtown with all the action going down i strike a match strike a match cook it up i m feeling so sick i feel so fucking sick on the bathroom floor gotta get out and get right hustling little girls cheating little boys yeah gotta get out gotta get out and get right gotta get out i gotta get out no more no more no more my eternal fire i m feeling so sick on the bathroom floor i m feeling so sick no more yeah i m feeling so sick i feel so sick no no more ,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The emotional alignment of the song with the user's prompt is low. The song lyrics express a feeling of sickness and discomfort, which somewhat aligns with the user's feeling of nausea caused by the stench. However, the intensity and context of the sickness in the song seem to stem from internal turmoil or substance abuse, rather than an external smell, leading to a score of 1. Contextually, the song does not relate to the specific scenario of being in an elevator or reacting to a bad smell, hence the score of 0. The lyrical coherence of the song is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and disjointed, but the theme of feeling sick is consistently conveyed, resulting in a score of 2. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual prompt."
I called the new boss ‘mom’ during the video call and wanted to crawl under my desk.,mama asked me where i went and i said i went away she asked me why i left and i told her i can t stay there s debts i gotta pay i might come back some day hopped in the back of the 95 chevy and drove it to the coast mom asked me if i got a job and i told her that i sell asked if she needed a few bucks at home and she told me go to hell and i think i might as well till then i ll surf the swell hopped in the back of the 95 chevy and drove it to the coast,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.5,"The song lyrics chosen do not align well with the user's emotional state of embarrassment and the desire to hide after mistakenly calling their boss 'mom'. The song discusses leaving home and interactions with a mother, which only tangentially touches on the theme of 'mom' but misses the mark on the specific context and emotion of the situation. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, telling a clear story of departure and strained familial relationships, but they do not effectively address the user's feelings or context."

The song primarily focuses on personal success in the music industry and overcoming past struggles, which does not directly relate to the excitement of attending a significant sports or competitive event. The lyrics, while somewhat coherent in expressing the artist's journey and achievements, are disjointed and repetitive, particularly with the repeated lines about having a 'golden ticket' and winning, which metaphorically could connect to success but doesn't directly tie to the user's situation. Overall, the song fails to capture the specific emotional and contextual essence of the user's prompt."
Walking past that abandoned lot at night makes my pulse race.,and 6 am in morningside the first car rushes by we walk down to the garden and the sunlight fills your eyes and stops me for a moment till i turn and look the other way the windows are all open and it s saturday and where i ride the evening turns to blue and fades away a silence hangs enchanted through sunset and the lane the air is charged with sunlight and your name is ringing through my mind cathedral bells and sunlit is the night,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.5,"The recommended song lyrics do not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual prompt. The user describes a feeling of heightened anxiety or fear while walking past an abandoned lot at night, which suggests a need for a song that captures a sense of unease or tension. However, the song lyrics depict serene and peaceful scenes, such as a morning walk, sunlight, and enchanting silence, which contrasts sharply with the user's emotional state. The lyrics themselves are somewhat poetic and maintain a certain fluency, hence the moderate score for lyrical coherence. Overall, the song fails to align well with the emotional intensity and the specific nighttime context described by the user."
A stranger held the door while I juggled coffee and my laptop—brightened my morning.,i looked you up and down i liked everything i saw from the fragile outline of your hips to the trembling movements in your jaw but then the coffee cup shattered on the kitchen floor you said that you couldn t take it anymore i knew you were leaving i knew you were going to bristol i watched you pack your bags saw you head up to the door but when the key broke off in the deadbolt lock you said that you couldn t take it anymore that was the second time you said that in one day why don t you just sit still it s going to be ok going to bristol going to bristol going to bristol going to bristol,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The song's emotional tone of distress and separation contrasts sharply with the user's prompt of a small, positive interaction that brightened their morning. The context of the song, focusing on a breakup and moving away, is entirely unrelated to the simple act of kindness described in the prompt. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, telling a clear story of a relationship ending and the subsequent departure, but they do not align with the user's experience or emotional state."
Scrolled past an old voicemail from her and suddenly the room felt empty.,the buzzing of the house has disappeared the glow is dimmed and contact s lost voices faces who were here the corner of the room was on and nothing else was needed no one else required nothing happens now it s all gone quiet for all intents for all our trust what was ever true the daily grind it sprang to life watching what was on instead of watching out the hours and hours and time to change i realise i m one of all the same but when i see you soon remind me how you lit up every room you knew that you were needed you talked and never tired how does it feel now that you ve been retired ,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of loss and emptiness, aligning well with the emotional prompt of feeling the absence marked by an old voicemail. The mention of 'the buzzing of the house has disappeared' and 'it's all gone quiet' resonates with the sudden emptiness described in the prompt, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on themes of absence and reminiscence, which is relevant but not directly addressing the specific trigger of the voicemail, thus receiving a moderate score. The lyrical coherence is somewhat lower due to the somewhat disjointed and abstract nature of the lyrics, making it harder to follow a clear narrative or message."

This gives the song a high score in emotional alignment. However, the song's context of overcoming hardships and darker times only partially matches the user's simple joy related to gardening, leading to a moderate score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and abstract, which affects their coherence, but they still maintain a clear theme of transformation and light, earning a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
He doodled a silly sketch of us on the fridge; totally melted my heart.,you looked liked pingu in the igloo your nose was cold you showed me the icicle that you found hanging from the roof i remember your entrance to the room i was in and the half pint glass you were holding that made you look bigger than you were you drew a charming stick man on my left hand and you told me not to wash it off we loved you we loved you,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a tender and affectionate moment, similar to the user's prompt about a heartwarming sketch, which scores high on emotional alignment. The mention of drawing on the hand parallels the doodling in the prompt, enhancing the contextual relevance, though the setting and specifics differ slightly, hence not a perfect score. The lyrics are somewhat poetic and maintain a narrative flow, ensuring good lyrical coherence. However, the overall match isn't perfect due to slight thematic deviations, such as the setting and the nature of the interaction."
Waiting outside the dentist’s room; my knee won’t stop bouncing.,bad blood saturating the sheets and the blankets good god there are ghosts floating up from the pavement they flip over the houses blood runs out from the basements in its unholy flow you remember this whimpering thick nauseous feeling from your step brother chasing you around with a staple gun when you were young it was fun and then suddenly pain became a very real thing do you remember that feeling similarly this isnt fiction well actually mostly it is or a series of irl moments cloaked in the vagueness that songs give but when theres nothing to say and youve got to say something fuck i dont even know we pass on the street and say hi cause we have to even though both of us are clearly just like i fucking hate you so stilted and silent not awkward just angry hey i gotta go but ill see you at the show its that song everybody loves but the are garbage and it stresses me out how often youre mentioned its like everyone we know collectively vomited up a pile of brown sweaters or something and were so impressed with the results that they put them on the wall and im so sad youre in my head and im so sorry its so venomous especially because weve got like maybe four or five words ever spoken between us but i cant heave my heart into my mouth i cant tell you i cant stop you i dont want to this first day of school shit just seems to keep happening everybody says man its so cool were so glad youre doing your own thing but worse than disdain is colossal indifference the smiles are so big and theres no one at the gig im either deep in the woods or on tv for everyone and i know its disgusting how much i think about myself in relation to nothing the things that arent gonna stay just arent gonna stay like i was getting a tooth pulled in the free clinic in portland in 2007 the dentist turned out to be this dude a drummer whose band id recorded and somehow that was comforting then the novocaine block kicked in it closed up my throat and i was ready to go home maybe once this record comes out then i can stop drinking that might look good on a press release or something if they even still do those wait im certain they still do those and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.33,"The song lyrics chosen do not align well with the user's emotional state of nervous anticipation while waiting outside a dentist's room. The lyrics are chaotic and touch on themes of discomfort and past trauma, which could potentially increase the user's anxiety rather than soothe it. The mention of a dentist and a dental procedure provides some contextual relevance, but it is brief and embedded in a narrative that is largely irrelevant to the user's situation. The lyrical coherence is low, with a stream-of-consciousness style that can be difficult to follow and might add to the listener's stress rather than alleviate it."

The emotional alignment scores a 3 as the lyrics reflect a sense of being overwhelmed and busy, which can parallel the stress of job interviews and rejections, but it doesn't fully capture the hopeful aspect of the user's mood. Contextually, the song scores a 2 because it primarily discusses the sacrifices made for a career, which is tangentially related to job searching but doesn't directly address the scenario of moving from a rejection to another opportunity. The lyrical coherence of the song is fairly strong, maintaining a consistent theme and narrative, earning a score of 3. However, the repetitive nature might detract from its overall impact. The overall score reflects these mixed alignments and the partial fit to the user's current situation."
Ran my first 5 k without stopping; pretty pleased with myself.,tried to call you n got the answer phone now i m glad i m free to spend a weekend on my own do the shopping jog in the park and there s a lot of housework that needs to be done i m turning myself into a superhero of sorts and i m so happy now you didn t take my call this morning,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song captures a sense of independence and self-satisfaction, which aligns somewhat with the emotion of being pleased with oneself, as expressed in the user's prompt about completing a 5k run. However, the song's focus on being glad about not being in contact with someone and doing chores diverges from the specific context of achieving a personal fitness milestone. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack fluency, affecting their overall coherence. The song does not directly celebrate the user's achievement or the specific context of running, which leads to a lower score in contextual relevance and lyrical coherence."
"Realised the meeting invite said 7 a.m., not p.m.—no wonder no one joined.",not submitted,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"As no song lyrics were submitted, it is impossible to evaluate the emotional alignment, contextual relevance, or lyrical coherence in relation to the user's prompt."
The lights flicked back on as soon as the storm ended—felt like exhaling.,alighted,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"The song recommendation provided, 'alighted,' does not offer enough information to fully assess its alignment with the user's emotional and contextual prompt. The single word 'alighted' could metaphorically align with the idea of lights coming back on, suggesting a return to normalcy or relief. However, without more lyrics or context, it is challenging to determine how well it reflects the emotion of relief or the specific scenario described. Additionally, the lack of complete lyrics makes it impossible to assess lyrical coherence."

Boxed up the holiday decorations; the living room looks strangely empty.,christmas time is here again it don t seem so different when last year which was filled with emptiness all around directionless,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of emptiness and a lack of direction, which aligns moderately well with the user's emotional state after removing holiday decorations, leaving the space feeling empty. The context of the song, focusing on the aftermath of Christmas, is highly relevant to the user's activity of boxing up holiday decorations. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low, as the lyrics are a bit disjointed and lack fluency, which might affect the overall impact and clarity of the message."
Opened the fridge and found a note that read ‘road trip tomorrow!’—didn’t see that coming.,yesterday alone i laid everything out on the carpet books kitchen things objects with specific purpose or none arranged them sideways in a grid on the floor there unmoored out of context and then considered it first the whole picture then everything individually humming along at the deadest pace imaginable one object then another and then the next and i wondered what they meant there if they meant anything still found notes camping supplies a book you bought in the desert identifying wildflowers pictures from vacations from parties kitschy gifts we bought from rest stops on that road trip out west objects everything itself and then memory all of it laid out there from the dining room the living room the hallway and the basement and the kitchen from that room we called the office but never used even the bathroom everything laid out there on the floor on the carpet out of context and i sat there for hours today i moved everything from the floor to the table in the dining room placed each thing carefully without reason or at least without one i understood or could describe there on the table together and when i was done and stepped back i realized what i had made keepsakes pictures letters ordinary objects all collected there a memorial and i thought of ones on highways or set by gravestones all the things you see there but dont understand but still bring a remembered thing back vividly invoke someones reality when there together in that place in that way out of context and i knew i had to take it down before anybody else saw tomorrow i plan to put them all somewhere those things in boxes side of the road attic maybe all these things that push and pull me through history to places i once was places i mightve gone places i ended up going postcards ticket stubs from one thing or another a personalized coffee mug neither your name nor mine phone cards and old phones a page from an old calendar i bought once at a thrift store and insisted on hanging that cycles of the moon print photos old boots of mine put them in boxes and i sat there for hours in the living room first then in the dining room moving things around picking things up and seeing where they took me to what place in history what moment on our timeline where we were where i was where i thought wed end up in this house or on the highway driving somewhere near christmas in the desert or anywhere else and i put them in boxes6,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of unexpected discovery and reminiscence, aligning somewhat with the emotional surprise and anticipation in the user's prompt about an unplanned road trip. The mention of road trips and objects related to travel in the lyrics enhances the contextual relevance. The lyrics are coherent, presenting a stream-of-consciousness narrative that explores memories and the significance of objects, although the long, unbroken format might challenge some listeners. Overall, the song captures the essence of looking back at past journeys and the emotions tied to them, fitting the theme of unexpected travel plans."
Watching my sister patiently guide my nephew through his first steps left me amazed by her dedication.,i m watchin sis go pitterpat said i can do that i can do that knew ev ry step right off the bat said i can do that i can do that one morning sis won t go to dance class i grab her shoes and tights and all but my foot s too small so i stuff her shoes with extra socks run seven blocks in nothin flat hell i can do that i can do that i got to class and had it made and so i stayed the rest of my life all thanks to sis i can do this that i can do i can do that ,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song captures the emotion of admiration and inspiration, similar to the user's amazement at their sister's dedication. This is reflected in the lyrics where the speaker is inspired by their sister's actions and decides to follow in her footsteps, which aligns well with the theme of familial influence and support. However, the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, which affects their overall coherence and fluency. The context of dance in the song is a slight deviation from the user's context of teaching a child to walk, but the underlying theme of learning and guidance remains relevant."
I just finished a comedy movie and found myself laughing out loud through the entire end credits.,on my own in the back thought of death made me laugh summer s sun a sinking hole we were young and passionate we were young,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of joy and amusement after watching a comedy movie. The lyrics, which mention thoughts of death and a sinking hole, contrast sharply with the light-hearted and cheerful mood typically associated with comedies. The context of the song, which seems to reflect on youth and possibly loss or melancholy, does not match the comedic and uplifting experience described by the user. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear narrative or fluency that could enhance understanding or emotional resonance."
"I just returned to my desk and found my meticulously organized files shredded and scattered everywhere, and I was absolutely furious.",got me fucked up,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The recommended song lyrics 'got me fucked up' somewhat align with the emotion of fury expressed in the prompt, hence a score of 2 for emotional alignment. However, the lyrics are extremely brief and lack depth, making it difficult to fully capture the specific context of the situation described (files being shredded and scattered), resulting in a score of 1 for contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is also low, scored at 1, due to the minimal content and lack of clarity or fluency in the lyrics. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."
The neighbor's car alarm blaring at sunrise grated on my nerves and ruined my morning.,i tried so hard to stay strong the first time i slept alone but the paint was ripped off my front door there was no one to open it though let s talk about it pull me into your darkness there s nothing left to give away nothing left to say today today but the paint got ripped off my front door the paint was ripped off my front door the paint was ripped off my front door,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The song's lyrics do not align well with the user's emotional state of irritation and disruption caused by a car alarm. The song seems to explore themes of loneliness and abandonment, which do not match the context of the user's annoyance with a noisy disturbance. The repetition of the phrase 'the paint was ripped off my front door' does not clearly connect to the user's experience. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent theme of loss and emptiness, but they lack clarity in their overall message and relevance to the user's situation."
"After staying up all night finishing that report, hearing my manager praise my work in the morning convinced me i’d made the right call.",listen to the sound listen to the sound everything always works out,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The recommended song lyrics align well emotionally, reflecting a sense of relief and validation which matches the user's feeling after receiving praise for hard work. Contextually, the lyrics are somewhat relevant as they suggest a positive outcome ('everything always works out'), which resonates with the user's experience of their decision being affirmed by their manager's praise. The lyrics are coherent and straightforward, though they are somewhat repetitive and lack depth, which might not fully capture the complexity of the user's initial stress and subsequent relief."
"My brother felt terrible all night, so I stayed by his side and made sure he had everything he needed.",well i spent all night alone with you and you weren t even there your eyes burned on me like the midnight sun and somewhere in the night i knew how much i really cared cause you re the one you re the one for me you are the one i tried to keep my distance afraid of striking out but protect myself from life is all i ve done so i got to tell you now before another night goes by that you re the one you re the one for me you are the one and sometimes it hits you right away and sometimes it takes awhile oh but now that you ve crept up on me there s nothing i can do to stay away from you though lord i ve tried to keep it down but resistance only moves it to the front so i got to tell you now and not worry what you ll say cause you re the one you re the one for me you are the one,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The emotional alignment of the song with the user's prompt is somewhat present, as the song mentions staying by someone's side and caring deeply for them, which reflects the user's act of caring for their brother. However, the song's primary focus on romantic love and personal confession dilutes this alignment, making it only partially relevant. Contextually, the song does not fit well with the theme of caregiving in a non-romantic, familial context as described in the prompt. The lyrics are coherent and follow a clear narrative about expressing hidden feelings, but they do not directly address the user's situation of caring for a sick sibling. Overall, the song's focus on romantic themes and confession makes it a less suitable choice for the given prompt."
Receiving an urgent call from my doctor asking me to come in immediately without any details left me completely uncertain about what was wrong.,i call to talk late at night end up crying when i told you everything s alright i was lying i m not so sure i want this anymore and i m not so sure i need it i thought i knew what it was that i wanted beginning to think i was wrong can t admit it i m not so sure i want this anymore and i m not so sure i need it but i m worried that if i walked out that door i wouldn t really leave it i ve never been one to walk through the fire i d rather jump from the top ended flying i m not so sure i want this anymore and i m not so sure i need it but i m worried that if i walked out that door i wouldn t really leave it,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.

However, the emotional intensity and curiosity driven by the discovery in an archive is not strongly reflected. Contextually, the song seems to focus more on personal relationships and hidden emotions rather than the thrill of discovery or historical revelations, making it only partially relevant. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and vague, lacking a clear narrative or fluency, which affects their overall coherence."
I just watched that cooking show and I’m longing to try making that chocolate soufflé tonight.,yeah i want a seven figure swagger loads of cheese mate loads of cheese double cheese i m making it this year seven figure swagger seven figure loads of cheese mate loads of cheese double cheese i m making it this year seven figure swagger seven figure loads of cheese mate loads of cheese double cheese i m making it this year seven figure swagger seven figure yeah i want a seven figure swagger loads of cheese mate loads of cheese double cheese i m making it this year seven figure swagger seven figure loads of cheese mate loads of cheese double cheese i m making it this year seven figure swagger seven figure,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of excitement and anticipation about trying a new cooking recipe. The song's repetitive focus on 'loads of cheese' and 'seven figure swagger' does not reflect the specific culinary endeavor of making a chocolate soufflé, nor does it capture the emotional nuance of the user's experience. The lyrics are highly repetitive and lack fluency, making them incoherent and irrelevant to the context of cooking a specific dessert."
"I opened the email to see that tonight’s concert had been canceled, leaving me utterly let down.",i was cut open on the way down reeling from the blow and you were there on the other line in between the tears and the lightshow what a disappointment i thought there d be so much more but all this talking is driving me insane and i was told if i was to sing along forget about myself we re all the same well maybe i should change my point of view dizzy in the morning and i m shaking in the afternoon there s never no warning when it s gonna hit and i m like an earthquake when i get thinking too much everything s falling and shaking and falling through my hands well maybe i should change my point of view well all this time we have together it s desperation for everybody it s wishful thinking for the whole human race or whoever 2,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song captures the emotional state of being let down and the turmoil that follows, which aligns well with the user's feelings of disappointment from the concert cancellation. The lyrics express a sense of disillusionment and emotional disturbance, resonating with the user's situation. However, the song's context about personal emotional upheaval and existential reflection only partially matches the specific event of a concert cancellation. The lyrics, while expressive and evocative, can be somewhat disjointed and abstract, making them less coherent in a straightforward narrative sense. Overall, the song does a good job of mirroring the user's emotional state but is less directly relevant to the specific context of a concert cancellation, and the lyrical flow could be clearer."
"I just found out the community center canceled the free cooking classes without telling me, and it felt unfair that they didn’t ask for my opinion.",i went to class you didn t show up i thought we said that we d keep in touch walk through town disassembled on a crutch just like we did when you were in love i left the house and i didn t miss much you opened your mouth and i lost my trust yeah i left the house for the first time in months for the first time in months now here i am disassembled as a whole when i got home i lost control,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.7,"The song captures a sense of betrayal and disappointment which aligns with the user's feelings of being treated unfairly, scoring a 3 in emotional alignment. However, the context of the song, which seems to focus more on personal relationships and emotional breakdown, only partially matches the user's experience with a community program, thus scoring a 2 in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, expressing a clear narrative of trust lost and emotional distress, earning a 3 in lyrical coherence. Overall, while the song resonates on an emotional level, its specific context and narrative do not perfectly align with the user's situation regarding the cooking classes."
"I just took a bite of my sandwich and realized it had gone bad, making my stomach turn.",i realize i m hungry i recognize the pain in my gut i don t know where it comes from or what i m gonna do about it this little pain inside my tiny tummy souplantaion fosters freeze in n out or chuck e cheese burger king or taco bell all these restaurants sound so well that s what i m gonna do about it this little pain inside my tiny tummy hamburger helper on those days when i sit home and fucking laze and when my budget is kind of low there s only so many good places to go that s what i m gonna do about it this little pain inside my tiny tummy,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics focus on hunger and the pain associated with it, which partially aligns with the user's experience of discomfort from eating a bad sandwich. However, the song's emphasis on deciding where to eat next and listing various food outlets does not closely match the user's immediate issue of feeling sick due to spoiled food. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack depth, focusing mainly on listing restaurant names and a recurring line about 'this little pain inside my tiny tummy,' which makes them only moderately coherent. Overall, the song does not effectively address the user's specific situation of discomfort and the negative experience of eating spoiled food."
I just waved enthusiastically at someone who wasn’t waving at me and wanted to disappear on the spot.,last night i saw someone with your eyes someone with your smile someone with your smile we danced and though glad that she had asked me to she didnt have your arms,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song captures a sense of awkwardness and discomfort, which aligns somewhat with the user's feeling of embarrassment. However, the song's focus on a romantic encounter and missing another person's specific traits (eyes, smile, arms) doesn't directly relate to the user's experience of an awkward social mishap. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but lack a clear narrative flow, which might make it harder for the user to find solace or direct relevance in them. Overall, the song does not effectively address the user's need to feel understood or comforted in their specific embarrassing moment."
I just found out my best friend is flying in for a surprise visit and I can’t stop smiling.,i got a big surprise when i saw you smile i never dreamed that it could be but now i realize since i saw you smile there s only happiness for me so bye bye blues bye bye blues bells ring birds sing sun is shining no more pining just we two smiling thru don t sigh don t cry bye bye blues blues,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The song's lyrics perfectly capture the emotion of happiness and surprise, aligning well with the user's feeling of joy upon learning about their best friend's unexpected visit. The mention of smiling and happiness resonates with the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song fits as it revolves around the theme of joy and pleasant surprises, though it doesn't specifically mention friendship or reunions, which slightly lowers its contextual score. The lyrics are coherent and flow well, maintaining a cheerful tone throughout, which enhances the listening experience and relevance to the user's situation."
"I just got word my friend is driving here through this raging thunderstorm, and each crack of thunder sent a chill down my spine.",we are in the storm ,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics 'we are in the storm' somewhat align with the emotional tone of anxiety and concern in the user's prompt, hence a score of 2 for emotional alignment. However, the lyrics are extremely brief and lack depth, providing very little context or detail about the storm or the emotions involved, which results in a score of 1 for contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is also low, scored at 1, due to the lack of fluency and completeness in the lyrics provided. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."
"I came home after a long day to find my partner had cleaned up and cooked dinner, and it made me realize how lucky I am to have them.",i woke up today i strapped my shoes on tight it s gonna be a long day i won t be home till tonight i m going out to the lake to see what i can bring in if anybody needs me tell them i ve gone fishing it seems like yesterday was lost but now i m found i ve got a great job that pays to spread god s joy around many have been lead astray i ll tell them what they ve been missing jesus is the only way and that s why i ve gone fishing i ve gone fishing i ve gone fishing ,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the emotional tone of the user's prompt. The user's experience is one of gratitude and appreciation for their partner's thoughtful actions, whereas the song focuses on an individual's day out fishing and spreading religious messages. The emotional alignment is low because the song's theme of escape and evangelism does not reflect the intimate, appreciative sentiment expressed in the prompt. Contextually, the song is also irrelevant as it does not address relationships or domestic life, which are central to the user's experience. The lyrics themselves are coherent and follow a clear narrative about fishing and spirituality, hence the moderate score in lyrical coherence."
"I just found my grandmother’s favorite shawl tucked in her chair, and tears welled up as I remembered her warmth.",there s a blanket of snow covering up the old road to the house where i was raised through the window i see the lights on the tree and a glow from the old fireplace though it all looks the same so much as changed from the way it used to be christmas memories of happy years gone by they come back to me and keep me warm inside still those memories make me cry now the stockings are filled the old house is still and the kids are all dreaming away there s that old easy chair me and daddy sat there waiting for santa s sleigh now daddy has gone but we ll carry on cause the little ones still need christmas memories of happy years gone by they come back to me and keep me warm inside still those christmas memories oh they mean so much to me oh those christmas memories make me cry,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of nostalgia and emotional warmth, aligning well with the user's feelings of missing a loved one, as triggered by finding a personal item. The mention of 'the old easy chair' and the familial memories tied to specific locations within a home resonate with the user's experience of finding their grandmother's shawl. However, the song's specific focus on Christmas slightly detracts from its contextual relevance, as the user's prompt does not mention this holiday. The lyrics are coherent and fluently convey a story of past family gatherings and the emotional impact of those memories, though the specific holiday theme might not perfectly align with the user's current emotional context."
"I opened my inbox this morning to find I’d received my scholarship award, and I can’t stop grinning from ear to ear.",i think i saw ol santa through my window christmas eve my eyes were really droopy but i really do believe it must ve been ol santa cause i saw his big red hat and i know my mom and dad can t fly like that oh no and then i heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door the same ol christmas trick my dad had played since i was four he stands outside my bedroom yelling ho ho ho because he knows i don t believe in santa claus no way i think my daddy sees me peeking from my door but he pretends he s santa anyway every year he tries to fool me but i m a big boy now i don t believe in santa or his sleigh no way so i went back to my bed and i curled up nice and tight i stared out of my window and i looked into the night and then all of a sudden through my window i could see santa claus was flying by and smiling at me santa claus santa claus it must ve been ol santa claus santa claus santa claus happy ho ho ho to you and then i heard ol rudolph tellin me to come outside he told me that ol santa wanted me to take a ride i climbed out of my window and i jumped onto his sleigh and then ol santa took me up and away  we flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below i saw my big red school house and the town square picture show it was really past my bedtime and so ol santa said little boys like you should be in bed so i hollered ho ho ho and i put on santa s hat then he let me hold the reins a while we pulled up to my window and i jumped back in my room and i waved goodbye to santa with a smile when i woke up christmas morning well it was clear and bright my parents said my window had blown open in the night i smiled as i told them that it must ve been the cat and they asked me where i got my big red hat yeah yeah c mon santa claus santa claus it must ve been ol santa claus santa claus santa claus happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you one more again,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,"The recommended song is a Christmas-themed narrative about a child's playful interaction with 'Santa Claus', which does not align with the user's emotional state of joy and accomplishment from receiving a scholarship award. The emotional alignment and contextual relevance scores are both 0, as the song's theme of childhood Christmas fantasy does not reflect the user's situation of academic achievement and personal success. The lyrical coherence of the song is relatively high, scoring a 4, as the lyrics are fluent and tell a clear, if whimsical, story. However, the overall effectiveness of this song as a match for the user's prompt is very low, leading to an overall score of 1."
"I woke up this morning to find a bouquet of flowers on my nightstand with a note that said ‘just because’, and my heart melted.",at this point in my life clearly i can see all the gifts he bestowed upon me that is why deep inside i have this joy there was once a time my soul was searching to find a place to nest now in this joy i can rest now my heart holds the love he has given me and that s all that i ll ever need to live believe and spread his love i m so glad i have this joy,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a deep sense of joy and gratitude, which aligns well with the user's emotional state of feeling touched and loved upon receiving the surprise bouquet. However, the song's context seems to focus more on spiritual or divine love and gratitude, rather than a romantic or personal gesture like the one described in the prompt. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, but they could be more structured and clear in conveying the message. Overall, while the song captures the emotion of joy and gratitude, it does not perfectly match the romantic or personal context of the user's experience."
"I just sat down to record my podcast and realized I hadn’t rehearsed my opening lines, and I felt my palms grow clammy.",and i have grown i have could ve sworn i have for long i was certain that i saw it clear i am you then your sweaty palms surround it and i have grown i have could ve sworn i had but i forgot that i ever really was here heaving with all my might hear the lightning through the sky heaving with all my might hear the lightning through this for long i was certain that i saw it clear i am you than your sweaty palms surrounded but i forgot that i was ever really was here ,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The emotional alignment of the song with the user's prompt is somewhat present, as the mention of 'sweaty palms' directly connects to the user's feeling of clamminess. However, the rest of the song's emotional tone and content do not clearly align with the anxiety or unpreparedness expressed in the prompt. Contextually, the song does not fit well with the specific scenario of recording a podcast and the associated nervousness due to lack of rehearsal. The lyrics are quite disjointed and repetitive, lacking clear fluency and making it difficult to derive a coherent message or theme, which affects the overall relevance and effectiveness in addressing the user's emotional and contextual needs."
I just watched the sunrise break through the clouds and felt sure today would bring new opportunities.,yeah just when i had the money to spend and i was always thinking it would never end then the time came to the end of the game don t you know and just when the sky got shiny and bright there never seemed to be an end of the light but then the clouds came it started to rain don t you know just when it was going just when it was going so good just when it just when it was going so good but just when the highway straightened out for a mile and i was thinking i d just cruise for a while a fork in the road bought a new episode don t you know baby don t you worry i said baby don t you cry we re going to get it together and i know you re asking why yeah just when baby,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics reflect a fluctuating emotional state, with moments of positivity quickly overshadowed by challenges and changes, which partially aligns with the user's feeling of optimism and new opportunities. However, the song primarily focuses on the end of good times and the arrival of unexpected challenges, which contrasts with the user's hopeful and positive outlook. Contextually, the song does not specifically relate to watching a sunrise or the anticipation of new opportunities, but rather discusses general life changes. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but jump between different scenarios and emotions, making it slightly difficult to follow a clear narrative or theme."
I just saw my project showcased in the company newsletter and couldn’t help but beam at what I’d accomplished.,i am a very important person i ve acquired a genetically altered handshake capable of speeds up to thirty miles an hour hair arranged by the most advanced landscape surveillance operators our company can afford i have a very expensive pen i use big words quite often in substitution for semantically equivalent words i attribute this success to my professional demeanor and my strong stock portfolio though it may not appear so i am quite comfortable in my surroundings i have everything let me show you around smile you fucker it s not often you get this chance love is just an exchange of corporate documents i ve reviewed your rapport and i feel you re a prospect for mechanical salvation this is a joint venture that will be mutually advantageous to both parties involved technically this is just a business merger a consolidation of liquid assets we are respectively geared towards customer service there is a great possibility for corporate sponsorship if you re willing i am sure we could synchronize agendas swift and efficient satisfaction oh satisfaction baby oh come on through innovative planning we could form a strong strategic partnership capable of overcoming sensitive and adverse predicaments which will be discussed at the next goals assessment meeting promotion possibility and additional benefits are diagrammed in my preliminary objective outline raises are granted based on performance,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.67,"The recommended song lyrics focus heavily on corporate and business-related themes, which aligns somewhat with the context of the user's prompt about a project being showcased in a company newsletter. However, the emotional tone of the song is quite cynical and satirical about corporate life, which does not match the user's positive and proud emotion expressed in the prompt. The lyrics are coherent in their theme but use complex and jargon-heavy language that might not resonate easily with all listeners. Overall, the song does not effectively capture the celebratory and personal achievement aspect of the user's experience."
"I just found an old photo of my childhood home tucked away in a drawer, and it made me realize how far I’ve come.",there s an old kodak camera in my dresser drawer i ran across it just this afternoon and i realized that i don t ever use it anymore in fact last time i did i think it was with you when we were down in cozumel we had the whole beach to ourselves and it s crazy now to think that it s all there on that film and i could take it to the store to be developed but what for i can still see everything just fine and who needs pictures with a memory like mine standing there i couldn t help but think about everything that might be on that roll i think it even has another trip we took i guess that must ve been at least three years ago when we were down in baton rouge and there wasn t much to do so we drove into new orleans every afternoon and i swear that you would think that it was only yesterday cause i can still see everything just fine who needs pictures with a memory like mine somewhere in my closet there s a cardboard box just sitting on a shelf it s full of faded memories and it s been there ever since the night you left oh just forgotten photographs to remind me of the past oh but i can still see everything just fine who needs pictures with a memory like mine yeah who needs pictures with a memory like mine,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.3,"The song's lyrics about finding an old camera and reflecting on past memories align well with the user's experience of finding an old photo and reminiscing about their childhood home. The emotional tone of nostalgia and reflection in the song matches the user's sentiment of realizing how far they've come. Contextually, the song fits as it discusses the process of looking back at old memories, similar to the user's experience with the photo. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear, fluent story about reminiscing and the power of memory, which enhances the song's relevance and emotional impact."
"I just got the call that my test results came back clear, and I felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders.",let me down now i m falling off the line and i can feel it crawling through my spine because in my room now i feel so divine not a worry running through my mind,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song lyrics chosen reflect a sense of relief and a positive shift in emotional state, which aligns well with the user's feeling of having a 'huge weight lift off their shoulders' after receiving good news about their test results. The emotional alignment score is therefore high. Contextually, the lyrics mention a transformation from a burdened state to feeling 'divine' and without 'a worry,' which resonates with the context of receiving relieving health news, though it does not specifically mention health or medical tests, leading to a moderate score. The lyrical coherence is average; the lyrics are somewhat abstract and metaphorical, making them less directly clear but still fluently expressing a shift from tension to relief."
I just reread the harsh message I sent my friend last night and felt a deep regret for how I spoke.,well i m sorry that you lost your shit and that s all i ve got to say about it tonight i ve thought you told me you never screamed out loud and you re proud of porno queen yes proud oh got out of bed regan it s all in your little head,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
"I just sat down for dinner and saw my father’s chair still empty, my heart ached and I can’t stop crying.",from my body out my eyes leaving my insides like the bed of ache forgotten was the story was the language never to breathe again or so it seems the surface of the earth felt like a fable after she drank up all the sea bury my father out in a church yard i have no one left to remember my name,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The recommended song lyrics score well on emotional alignment, capturing the deep sense of loss and emptiness that accompanies the absence of a loved one, as described in the user's prompt. The mention of burying a father aligns closely with the user's emotional state. Contextually, the lyrics fit the theme of loss and mourning, though the abstract and somewhat disjointed nature of the lyrics might not perfectly resonate with the specific scenario of sitting down for dinner. The lyrical coherence is lower as the lyrics are somewhat fragmented and cryptic, which might make it difficult for the user to find a clear and straightforward connection or comfort in them."
"I just discovered a heartfelt letter from my childhood friend tucked inside an old book, and I was completely caught off guard.",this is the letter that i wrote before see in those words i wrote i had no fear yeah i was about 10 years old and uh it was christmas day i remember waking up looking at myself and thinking how amazing it is to be what an amazing feel that is but you do forget you know this is what i m coming for more ,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song's emotional alignment scores a 3 as it captures a sense of nostalgia and reflection, which resonates with the user's experience of finding a childhood letter. However, the context of the song, which seems to focus on a specific memory of Christmas and self-reflection, only partially aligns with the theme of rediscovering a friend's letter, earning a score of 2. The lyrical coherence is low, scoring a 1, due to disjointed phrases and a lack of clear narrative flow, making it difficult to fully grasp the intended message or emotion. Overall, the song partially matches the user's emotional and contextual prompt but struggles significantly with clarity and coherence in its lyrics."
I really look up to my brother. I hope I can be like him one day.,i hope my little brother puts a call in today i hope he don t forget where he came from i hope he never has to deal with wrongin someone cause i lived with many ghosts when i was younger and i will live with many ghosts until i go i hope he s right in the head i hope he s right in the head i hope he s right in the head even if he has to wrong someone and i hope his guardian angel puts a gun in his hand if ever they get ambushed or pursued i hope she sticks around when he does dirty in this dirty duel he s brewed and though the names will get changed to protect the innocent he said i hope the names will get changed to protect me cause i lived with many ghosts when i was younger and i will live with many ghosts until i go,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,"The emotional alignment of the song with the user's prompt is low (scored 1) because the song's tone and content are more somber and conflicted, focusing on hoping the brother avoids hardships and negative influences, which contrasts with the user's simple admiration and aspirational feelings towards their brother. The contextual relevance is slightly better (scored 2) as it does address a relationship with a brother, but the context in the song involves darker themes of protection and conflict rather than inspiration and role modeling. The lyrical coherence is moderate (scored 3), as the lyrics maintain a consistent narrative about concern for a brother's wellbeing, though the themes are somewhat disjointed with mentions of ghosts and armed protection. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's positive and aspirational emotional context regarding their brother."
I watched this concert today and couldn’t stop laughing and smiling. It just made me feel so light and entertained.,to open the show i always like to do one thing that is impossible so right now i m going to suck this piano into my lungs there ok let s get started we re having some fun though aren t we kids how many people are here tonight raise them up still four dollars to get in four dollars haha that s not bad though oh you know four dollars in today s word inflation and all that it s like nothing it s like gee i got four dollars i think i ll throw it out into the street oh i can come in here for four dollars okay what happens this is not las vegas in las vegas it s fifteen dollars to get in you know it s worth it because there s a million people on stage and everything s moving real fast and you can t understand a word they say but it doesn t matter and you just sit there and you go wow look at the tits i ll bet there s 57 tits up there but this is four dollars you know rent a car and the opening act in vegas is always like a pop singer you know and they bring him out and he s really good but he moves so fast he s got to he s got like 15 minutes he s got to get it all in they introduce him you know ladies and gentlemen the sands hotel is proud to introduce mr johnny duke let s bring him out hey thank you very much and it s great to be here and certainly united states tuscan wisconsin hey thank you like to introduce the band biff tom jack we got nothing here but a couple of gamblin jokes for you because i gotta be me i gotta be me sammy davis jr personal friend of mine okay now i d like to do a little dancing for you it s impossible to put a cadillac in your nose it s just impossible ok a couple gambling jokes for you ok the hills are alive with the sound of money hey thank you do i look alright you bounce around but anyway as i was saying we re uh we re basically into the intellectual scene up here and that s why we re not into that kind of entertaining huh hey um and it is an intellectual town i enjoy coming here like for example see things are always happening to me up here that are so above everything else like before the show i was standing backstage and a couple came back and asked me if i was bi and well i studied a little spanish in high school but uh not enough to really be bi you know but i didn t want to look stupid so i said yeah i m bi and uh they said well we would like you to come over after the show because we ve got some s m people coming over and i said hey great spaniards and mexicans so it ll be interesting to go there after the show speak a little spanish and have the intellectual thing which is what i m into ,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.3,"The song lyrics reflect a humorous and light-hearted atmosphere, aligning well with the user's emotions of laughter and feeling entertained, thus scoring high on emotional alignment. The context of a performance or show in the lyrics also matches the user's experience of watching a concert, leading to a high score in contextual relevance. However, the coherence of the lyrics is lower as the narrative is somewhat disjointed and rambling, which might make it difficult for some listeners to follow the storyline or the humor seamlessly."
I’m honestly so mad right now. I trusted someone again and they hurt me—how can people keep doing this?,there are people who i trust there are people who trust me and i don t know why they re choosing to confide in someone who will talk about anything there are people who i miss there are people who miss me and i don t know why they re investing all their time into someone with my history so now i m numb and it s because of everything my eyes are tired my body s tired of waking up and still being me,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics chosen reflect a strong emotional alignment with the user's feelings of betrayal and disappointment, scoring a 4 in emotional alignment. The lyrics express a sense of mistrust and self-doubt, resonating with the user's experience of being hurt by someone they trusted. Contextually, the song scores a 3 as it touches on themes of trust and personal relationships, which are relevant to the user's situation, though it slightly deviates by focusing more on the singer's self-reflection and doubts rather than directly addressing betrayal by others. The lyrical coherence scores a 4, as the lyrics are fluent and convey a clear, introspective narrative, though they could be more direct in addressing the specific emotional context of betrayal. Overall, the song is quite suitable for the user's emotional state and context, but could be more focused on the aspect of betrayal to fully align with the user's current feelings."
"There’s this person I deal with regularly, and the way he speaks just really irritates me. I don’t know why it gets to me so much.",i m so frustrated some things are making me so sick inside aw go with your heart go with your heart yeah right quit tugging me aw i m just not good enough for you let s change let s be something we re not let s be something everybody else is ah so much built up inside it s fucking ridiculous i don t know if i should freak the fuck out on you or just sit back and laugh you want more you don t have anything me me i have everything yeah i have everything what more could i ask for nothing at all why did it have to be this way at the end why did it have to be this way at the end 1,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics chosen reflect a high level of frustration and irritation, which aligns well with the user's emotional state regarding their annoyance with a person's speech. This scores a 4 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song fits as it deals with interpersonal conflict and emotional distress, scoring a 3. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low, scoring a 2, due to the disjointed and somewhat chaotic expression of thoughts, which might make it harder for the user to find a clear, relatable narrative or message."
Someone at work has been handling things incredibly well. I just wanted to say I genuinely respect how he manages everything.,he is a mighty good god for him there s nothing to hard there is no problem he can t solve he is the lord of all in him i find no fault in him there is no failure in him i will not lack he is the lord of all in you i find no fault in you there is no failure in you i will not lack you are the lord of all you are the lord of all yes you are yes you are you are the lord of all ,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song lyrics focus on praising and acknowledging the omnipotence and perfection of a deity, which somewhat aligns with the user's intent to express admiration and respect for a colleague's management skills. However, the emotional alignment is only moderate (scored 2) because the song's focus on divine attributes doesn't precisely mirror the secular admiration intended for a colleague. Contextually, the song is not very relevant (scored 1) as it addresses spiritual or religious themes rather than a workplace or professional context. The lyrics are somewhat coherent (scored 3), maintaining a consistent theme of faultlessness and leadership, but they are repetitive and lack depth in narrative or varied expression."
"I’ve been taking care of a little bunny for a couple of years, and I feel so responsible for his well-being. He means a lot to me.",you know that i care what happens to you and i know that you care for me so i don t feel alone or the weight of the stone now that i ve found somewhere safe to bury my bone and any fool knows a dog needs a home a shelter from pigs on the wing,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.3,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of care and responsibility, aligning well with the user's emotional state regarding their pet bunny. The mention of not feeling alone and finding a safe place resonates with the user's feelings of attachment and protectiveness. However, the contextual relevance is lower because the lyrics specifically mention a dog, which could slightly disconnect from the user's experience with a bunny. The lyrics are coherent and flow well, making sense within the context of expressing care and seeking shelter, though the reference to 'pigs on the wing' might be a bit obscure without further context."
I just got here and I feel completely disoriented. I don’t understand what’s going on or what I’m supposed to be doing.,i don t know who you think you are i don t know what you re doing here i don t know what s going on here i don t know how it s supposed to be i i don t have the vaguest notion whose it is what it s all for i don t know i m not crying laughin mostly as you can see,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics strongly align with the user's feelings of disorientation and confusion, as reflected in the repeated phrases 'I don't know' and expressions of uncertainty about the situation. This scores high in emotional alignment. Contextually, the lyrics also match the theme of being lost or unsure about one's purpose or role, which is relevant to the user's state. However, the coherence of the lyrics is somewhat lower, as the repetitive and somewhat disjointed phrases may not provide a clear narrative or fluent expression, which could potentially add to the user's feeling of disorientation rather than offering clarity or comfort."
Lately I’ve had this urge to dive into new topics and ideas—I just feel intrigued about everything around me.,i seem to lately notice more and more each day that everything is so messed up until you walk around my way and everything is so unusual whenever you re around nothing is how it was found so i say chorus let s spend some time together even though stormy weather cause everything i remember points to all good things not a cloud up in the sky at all whenever you are near just the sunny blue projection of the atmosphere i wonder what i would be like to be deep inside of you i think that i would like to know so i say,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song lyrics partially align with the user's emotional state of feeling intrigued and eager to explore new ideas, as indicated by the sense of noticing more and the desire to delve deeper ('i wonder what i would be like to be deep inside of you'). However, the song seems to focus more on a personal relationship and the emotional changes brought by another person, which doesn't perfectly match the user's context of intellectual curiosity. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and lack clarity in their narrative, making it difficult to fully grasp a coherent message, which affects the lyrical coherence score."
"More than anything right now, I just want to grow and improve. I want to become someone I can be proud of.",we can pretend who we can be a dancer in a top hat or a captain of the sea i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song's lyrics align well with the user's emotional state of wanting to grow and improve into someone they can be proud of, as it emphasizes being oneself and presenting that identity to the world. This reflects a strong desire for personal authenticity and self-acceptance, which is central to personal growth. However, the song's contextual relevance is moderate as it doesn't directly address the process of growth or improvement but rather focuses on the end state of self-acceptance and authenticity. The lyrical coherence is average; the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and simplistic but still effectively convey the message of self-identity and authenticity."
"I thought I could rely on someone close to me, but they let me down again. It hurts more than I expected.",when she sat me down just to tell me i m alone again the only thing i thought was that i don t need any friends cause they re all living in my head and things will never be the same but i don t think i d have it any other way and my thoughts haven t really changed the only thing i can t figure out is who s to blame for all my selfish deeds undone i guess that i m the only one who knows that in the end i didn t try hard enough i can t wait to die alone,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of betrayal and loneliness, aligning well with the user's emotional state of feeling let down by someone close. This scores high in emotional alignment. The context of the song, dealing with introspection and realization of personal faults after a disappointment, somewhat matches the user's situation of dealing with unexpected hurt from a trusted individual, thus the moderate score in contextual relevance. However, the coherence of the lyrics is lower due to the somewhat disjointed and abrupt transitions in thoughts, making it harder to follow a clear narrative or emotional progression."
"I tried to accept things the way they are, but I can’t anymore. I don’t agree with what’s happening, and I think I need to walk away.",it s not like it hasn t come to this point before but it seems like you mean it when you walk that way no it don t please me to quit this easy but there s the door you know you d be better off if you stay babe babe babe please turn around babe babe babe baby don t turn it down it s not a thing like me to beg and plead but i m just at a loss for words to say you got me spitting out things that i don t believe cause you keep hitting pause and i wanna play babe babe babe please turn around babe babe babe baby don t turn it down turn around turn around turn around babe babe babe please turn around babe babe babe baby don t turn it down  turn around turn around turn around,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song reflects the emotional turmoil and indecision described in the user's prompt, especially the struggle with the decision to walk away, which aligns well with the emotional aspect of the prompt. Contextually, the song deals with a plea for someone to stay rather than walking away, which partially aligns with the user's situation of contemplating leaving. However, the song's lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack clarity in conveying a coherent message, which affects the lyrical coherence score."

Now I can’t stop feeling ashamed.,you came around with your eyes dancing down and we never even talked that much embarrassingly enough i asked your friends where the hell you been well they really shut me down but i didn t stop looking around let me be right there let me in let me be right there1,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song captures the emotion of embarrassment and rejection, aligning well with the user's feelings of shame after being laughed at. The context of seeking acceptance and facing rejection from peers is relevant, though the song's scenario of directly interacting with the person of interest and their friends differs slightly from the user's experience of indirect rejection through laughter. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, but the flow and clarity could be improved for better understanding. Overall, the song resonates with the user's emotional state and context but could benefit from clearer lyrical expression."

However, the song's context, focusing on a romantic relationship and personal interactions, does not match the user's context of excitement about a new kitchen appliance, resulting in a score of 0 for contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves, while somewhat repetitive and focused on a specific scenario, maintain a basic level of fluency and sense, warranting a score of 2 for lyrical coherence. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's prompt in terms of both emotion and context, leading to a low overall score."

The lyrics express a deep sense of appreciation and interconnectedness, which resonates with the user's feelings of being grateful for everything and everyone in their life, thus scoring a 5 in contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence scores a 4 as the lyrics are mostly clear and convey a meaningful message, though the structure and grammar could be slightly more polished for enhanced clarity."

The mention of hurt and the inability to stop thinking about the person matches the emotional weight described in the prompt. However, the song introduces an element of betrayal ('to think that you'd lie to me'), which might not perfectly align with the user's context if their loss does not involve deceit, thus slightly lowering the contextual relevance score. The lyrics are coherent and express a clear narrative of emotional pain and reminiscence, making them easy to understand and relate to."

The lyrics reflect a positive, uplifting mood, matching the user's emotional state of continuous smiling and happiness. Contextually, the song's theme of self-realization and personal change resonates with the idea of embracing a joyful life, although it introduces broader themes of societal change and self-help that slightly diverge from the personal joy described in the prompt. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the repetitive structure and casual language convey the song's message effectively, though some lines could be clearer or more polished to enhance understanding."
There’s someone I can’t stop thinking about lately. I think I’m in love with them.,she was always was talking about these crazy things that i never understood i uh word she said i all i understand that she was the girl i sat up at night thinking about in love in love in love in love in love so that s that s what i think is love when i m better cause she s here,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a strong emotional connection to someone, aligning well with the user's feelings of being in love, which scores high on emotional alignment. The context of infatuation and constant thoughts about another person is somewhat captured, though the song's focus on confusion and misunderstanding slightly deviates from the user's clear emotional declaration of love. The lyrical coherence is lower due to the disjointed and somewhat unclear expression in the lyrics, making it harder to fully grasp the narrative or emotional depth consistently."
I stood in front of a huge and wasn't able to blurt out a single sentence. My knees were shaking the whole time.,this one brought me down to my knees i had to hold onto the wall my knees shaking quivering my head feels like a frisbee,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The recommended song lyrics align well with the emotional aspect of the user's prompt, particularly capturing the physical sensations of knees shaking and needing support, similar to the user's experience of being overwhelmed and physically unstable. However, the context of the song isn't fully clear in relation to the user's situation of being unable to speak in front of a crowd, as the lyrics do not explicitly mention a social or performance context. The lyrical coherence is somewhat low as the lyrics are a bit disjointed and abstract, making it harder to grasp a clear narrative or fluent expression."
I just know that tomorrow is going to be the best day ever,today s gonna be a beautiful day uh huh no more waiting for the usual thing uh huh don t dare waste your time boy don t dare waste your time no more waiting for the usual thing uh huh what can i do to make this plan go through uh huh approach then in a different way uh huh some day i ll get it right i swear i ll get it right today s gonna be a beautiful day uh huh today is gonna be a beautiful day i ll be sick you ll be proud take care and don t upset the crowd today is gonna be a beautiful day uh huh don t dare waste your time boy some day i ll get it right cause today s gonna be a beautiful day uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics reflect a positive and optimistic outlook, aligning well with the user's anticipation of 'the best day ever.' The repeated affirmations of 'today's gonna be a beautiful day' resonate with the user's hopeful emotion, scoring a 4 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song's theme of seizing the day and making the most of it matches the user's forward-looking excitement about tomorrow, meriting a score of 4. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat disjointed with repetitive phrases and a lack of clear narrative progression, leading to a score of 3 in this category. Overall, the song is quite fitting for the user's mood and expectations, but could benefit from more structured lyrics."
"Today someone told me I don't belong, but I know that I must fight for my ideals and show them to the world!",she said why do you have to go no one out there knows you and i said you don t you just assume you think you are something you think you are something he said why do you have to go no one out there loves you so you re suppose to be my ideal can t even deal with yourself i need new heroes he said why do you have to go no one out there is shameless so you re supposed to be my ideal can t even deal with yourself i need i need i need new so you re supposed to be my ideal can t even deal with yourself i need new heroes,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.67,"The song lyrics partially align with the user's emotional state of feeling unaccepted and the need to prove oneself, as reflected in the repeated questioning of 'why do you have to go' and the notion of not being loved or known. However, the song's focus on the speaker's disillusionment with their 'heroes' and the lack of support doesn't fully capture the user's resolve to fight for their ideals and show them to the world. Contextually, the song touches on themes of rejection and searching for new role models, which loosely connects to the user's situation but misses the proactive, positive aspect of the user's determination. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, lacking clear fluency and making it difficult to derive a coherent message, which affects the overall effectiveness of the song as a therapeutic match."

However, the repetition and lack of clear narrative or progression in the lyrics make it difficult to fully connect with the user's specific context of understanding a previously unclear situation. The lyrical coherence is very poor due to the repetitive and fragmented nature of the text, which lacks fluency and does not form a coherent message. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs due to these issues."

However, the emotional tone of the lyrics does not strongly convey relaxation, but rather a more neutral or observational mood. Contextually, the song does mention a show, but it focuses more on the events leading up to it rather than the aftermath or the feeling of relaxation the user described. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear progression, which affects their coherence. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional state or context of relaxing after a show."

I really regret what I did.",i thought about sitting on the floor in second grade i couldn t keep the pace i thought i was the only one moving in slow motion while the other kids knew something i did not but if i acted like a clown i thought it d get me throughit did but that don t work no more you re not a kid no more i thought i d do some traveling never did regrets regrets i thought about the hours wasted watching tv drinking beer i thought about the things i thought about until immobilized with fear and all the great ideas i had and how we just made fun of those who had the guts to try and fail and then i ended up in jail regrets regrets in for a day seems the police had make a computer mistake said there must be thousands like me with the same name anyway i thought about the things i settled for or never tried i never visited my grandma even once when she was sick before she died so i don t blame you if you never come to see me here again regrets regrets1,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of regret and introspection, aligning well with the user's emotional state of realizing a past mistake and feeling remorseful. The context of reflecting on past actions and their consequences is also relevant to the user's prompt. However, the lyrical coherence is slightly lower due to the somewhat disjointed narrative and abrupt shifts in the storyline, which might make it harder for the user to fully connect with the song's message."

I just feel this overwhelming sadness I don’t know how to handle.,i can t take anymore i can t breathe i m sick of this goddamn darkness sick of sadness and tears i throw it all up every single day together with last night s dinner i have lost myself completely i have convinced myself i am someone else for god s sake i need to be real i need touch i need people i have to turn my life around but i will still be myself won t i ,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics chosen reflect a strong emotional alignment with the user's feelings of overwhelming sadness and the inability to cope, scoring a 4. The raw expression of despair and the need for change resonate well with the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song scores a 3 as it addresses the theme of emotional turmoil and the struggle to find oneself amidst personal darkness, which is relevant but slightly more intense than the user's description of just feeling sad. The lyrical coherence scores a 2 as the lyrics, while powerful, are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear, fluent narrative structure, which might make it harder for the user to fully connect with the song's message."
My family just told me something completely unexpected... I’m still trying to wrap my head around it.,sometimes life surprises because you d never expect it to be that dangerous disguises that you never expect to see some things never change nothing s going to change that some things you can t explain like why we re all embracing conventional wisdom in a world that s just so unconventional made you turn around but you never expected to see that that s what makes that sound that you never expect to hear they don t know they re wrong but you know that they never can see that that s what makes them strong that they know that we ll never see1,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.33,"The song's lyrics touch on the theme of unexpected events and surprises, which aligns somewhat with the user's emotional state of trying to process unexpected family news. This gives it a moderate score in emotional alignment. However, the lyrics are more general about life's unpredictability and don't specifically address family dynamics or personal revelations, leading to a lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is somewhat disjointed with repetitive phrases and a lack of clear narrative, making it harder to follow, thus receiving a lower score in that category."
