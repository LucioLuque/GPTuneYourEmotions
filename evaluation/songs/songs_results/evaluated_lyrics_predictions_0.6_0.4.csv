Watching my teammate stay late to coach the interns after hours left me genuinely inspired.,they had been listening to our music and was inspired by what we did and just the fact that ya know big pun was covering it and getting at me to be in the video it made me feel good like a legend before my times they did that like nobody else could do that cause that was one of those classic records that was like if you touch it you gotta really know what you doing or you really mess up the ingredients and they touched it and really put they own ingredients on it to make it sound real smooth,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the emotional tone of inspiration described in the user's prompt. The lyrics discuss the impact of someone's music and the honor of being recognized by peers, which only slightly touches on the theme of inspiration but does not directly reflect the specific scenario of a teammate coaching interns. Contextually, the song's focus on music industry experiences and legacy does not match the user's context of a workplace or team environment. The lyrical coherence is somewhat fluent but lacks a clear structure and can be difficult to follow, leading to a moderate score in coherence. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."
That clip of a golden retriever chasing bubbles still has me giggling at my desk.,get back get back get back get back get back hey you why why i laugh ,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The song's emotional alignment scores a 2 as it seems to capture a sense of playful energy which could align with the joy and amusement of watching a golden retriever chase bubbles. However, it lacks a direct connection to the feeling of giggling or light-heartedness. The contextual relevance is low, scoring a 1, because the lyrics do not specifically relate to dogs, bubbles, or the specific scenario described. The lyrical coherence is also low, scoring a 1, as the lyrics are repetitive and somewhat disjointed, making it difficult to derive a clear or fluent message from them. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual prompt, leading to a low overall score."
The courier dumped my brand-new keyboard in a puddle and walked off—I'm fuming.,i m a self searching man at least i thought i was in those days i m okay i spose but still i snort up loads of cocaine they say it s down to mistrust abandonment and self hate i stare em in the eye and cry to fuck em if it felt great i struggle in myself place a bubble built around my life and if i haven t been a part of nothing in my pounding mind then fuck it i ll just sit within a grin and pick another time and distance in to mix the gin and substance in my fucking life cuz nothing knows the love inside feel it but the valve is clocked pissing out the liquids by the thousands to the fountain pots and none of your umbrellas could resist the muddy pounding drops with every dripping tear and all the shouting in this house i ve locked so try breaking in and see how far your candle burns it s pitch black forever in this mountain of abandoned words mismatching tenants in a crowded vegetated patch staring at the rusty jerrycan again now take a match one simple weed smoking alcoholic tosser one little key opens out your options proper stomp on the beat talk shit and down a vodka stop living weak own a house and see the doctor until the flames collapse i m comforting the heat i know it takes a man to stab a drunkard to his feet but i m tired the crusade of facts has played a random help but who s brain is who s mate i can t be arsed to slap myself it s never my fault i ve come to terms on my denial it seems to be the only thing to serve my custom of a smile the grief beneath the sober thing that burns enough to comfort sid before i m rich and bubbling i m eating out the fucking bin so fuck the normal way with corners i m just walking straight fuck a spoon fuck a knife i m all about the fork to face i m walking round my awkward mates that weep outside this doorstep and force stress deep inside a portion of my boring head i was pulled out with forceps i didn t wanna leave the womb i didn t wanna see the truth i didn t wanna breathe cuz it s a disgusting mistrusting dustbin we sit fucked in lusting for drug fixes fixed lost in nothing ,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The song lyrics chosen do not align well with the user's emotional state of anger and frustration due to a specific incident involving a courier and a keyboard. The song's themes of self-destruction, substance abuse, and deep personal turmoil do not match the context of the user's situation, which is more about a momentary anger and disappointment. The lyrics themselves are somewhat incoherent and disjointed, making it difficult to derive a clear message or emotional resonance that would be relevant to the user's experience."
The elevator keeps dinging on every floor even when nobody’s inside; it’s testing my patience.,i wake to feel it all like a drum inside my chest pulled the cable from the wall but the buzzing never rests now i gotta go and you re unimpressed my choices never small and you know i never rest but you always see me fall i can t stop it cause now we re losing light i can t stop it let s sleep on it another night hours passing losing light if you re wondering let s sleep on it another night what d you come here for dodging me like a swinging door i know what you re waiting for but your patience wore out fast i gotta go and i m unimpressed my choices never small and you know i never rest and you can t catch my fall,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
My colleague refactored the legacy code and now it runs twice as fast—exactly what we needed.,we have the technology we have the technology1,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,"The song's repeated phrase 'we have the technology' loosely aligns with the theme of technological improvement or enhancement, which is somewhat relevant to the context of refactoring code. However, the emotional alignment is weak as the song does not convey any specific emotions related to success, relief, or satisfaction that might be felt after such an achievement. The lyrical coherence is very poor due to the repetitive and incomplete nature of the lyrics provided, lacking any substantial content or fluency."
"Let me know the moment you get home so I can relax, please.",do you want me to go i ll drive home it s alright hold the thought so tightly it was just a passing thing come inside have a seat i ll be with you soon you don t seem to have feeling turn the lights off when you leave,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song's emotional alignment scores a 2 as it touches slightly on themes of waiting and concern, which aligns somewhat with the user's need for reassurance once someone is safely home. However, the song's primary focus seems to be on someone leaving rather than arriving, which mismatches the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song scores a 1 because it deals more with someone potentially leaving (or being asked to leave), which is quite opposite to the user's context of waiting for someone to arrive home. The lyrical coherence scores a 2, as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and vague, making it difficult to grasp a clear and fluent narrative or emotion throughout the song."

The song does not address the user's specific context of navigating a website or making online transactions, resulting in a score of 0 for contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves, while whimsical and repetitive, lack a coherent narrative or logical progression, earning a low score in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional or contextual needs."
I can’t stop wondering what the northern lights look like in person.,friday night and i don t have a clue just in the crowds we re dreaming as we move i wonder who we are i wonder who we are tonight and i know that someone s following me my littered face on the street the loveliest season has taken you write my name in the leaves i wonder who we are i wonder who we are tonight,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song's emotional tone of wonder and introspection partially aligns with the user's sense of curiosity about the northern lights, hence a score of 2 for emotional alignment. However, the song's lyrics primarily focus on self-identity and existential musings in a crowded, possibly urban setting, which does not closely relate to the natural, awe-inspiring phenomenon of the northern lights. Therefore, it receives a score of 1 for contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is somewhat disjointed and abstract, making it difficult to follow a clear narrative or theme, resulting in a score of 2. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's prompt about the northern lights."

Spent a week on that proposal and it didn’t even make the meeting agenda—ouch.,appears this could not be fetched ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Without the lyrics of the recommended song, it is impossible to evaluate how well the song matches the user's emotional and contextual prompt. Therefore, all scores are rated as 0, indicating a very poor match due to the lack of information provided."
My teammate keeps blaring voice notes on speaker in the open office; I swear earbuds were invented for a reason.,maybe there are cartwheels in your mouth maybe your words will grow up to be a gymnasts maybe you have been kicking people with them by accident i know some people get a whole lot of rocking in the rocking chair and the ones who dont sometimes get rocks in their voice boxes and their voice boxes become slingshots maybe you think my heart looks like a baby squirrel but you absolutely missed when you told the class i have head lice cause i one hundred percent absolutely do not have head lice and even if i do it is a fact that head lice prefer clean heads over dirty ones so i am clean as a whistle on a tea pot my mother says it is totally fine if i blow off steam as long as i speak in an octave my kindness can still reach my kindness knows mermaids never ever miss their legs in the water cause there are better ways to move through the ocean than kicking so guess what if i ever have my own team i am picking everyone first even the worst kid and the kid with the stutter like a skipping record cause i know all of us are scratched even if you cant hear it when we speak my mother says most people have heartbeats that are knocking on doors that will never open and i know my heart is a broken freezer chest cause i can never keep anything frozen so no i am not always crying i am just thawing outside of the lines and even if i am always crying it is a fact that salt is the only reason everything floats so good in the dead sea and just cause no one ever passes notes to me doesnt mean i am not super duper in fact my super duper might be a buoy or a paper boat the next time your nose gets stuck up the river cause it is a fact that our hearts stop every for a milli second every time we sneeze and some peoples houses have too much dust some peoples fathers are like attics ive heard attics have monsters in their walls and shaky stares i think if i lived in a house with attic id nightmare a burglar in my safety chest and maybe id look for rest in the sticks and stones cause my mother says a person can only swallow so much punch before hes drunk on his own fist but the only drunk i ever knew was sleeping in the alley behind our church and jesus turned water into his wine so even god has his bad days but on your bad days couldnt you just say hey im having a bad day instead of telling me im stupid or poor or telling me i dress like a boy cause maybe i am a boy and a girl maybe my name is andrea andrew so what it is a fact that bumblebees have hair on their eyes and humans also should comb though everything they see like an anchorman is not a sailor like the clouds might be a pillow fight like my mother says every bird perched on a telephone wire will listen to the conversations running through its feet to decide the direction of its flight so i know every word we speak can make hurricanes in peoples weather veins or shine their shiny shine so maybe sometime you could sit beside me on the bus and i could say guess what it is a fact that manatees have vocal chords but do not have ears and beethoven made music even when he could no longer hear and i know every belt that has hit someones back is still a belt that was built to hold something up and it is fact that egyptians slept on pillows made of stone but its not hard for me to dream that maybe one day youll write me back like the day i wrote the lightening bug to say i smashed my mason jar and i threw away the lid i didnt want to take a chance that id grow up to be a war i want to be a belly dance or an accordion or a pogo stick or the fingerprints the mason left in the mortar between the bricks to prove that he was here that he built a roof over someones head to keep the storm from their faith my mother says thats why we all were born and i think shes right so write back soon sincerely yours 1,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The recommended song lyrics are abstract and poetic, focusing on personal expression and resilience against verbal abuse or misunderstanding. However, they do not align well with the user's prompt about frustration with a teammate's behavior in an office setting. The emotional alignment is low because the song's themes of personal hurt and misunderstanding do not directly reflect the user's annoyance and frustration with a specific behavior. Contextually, the song also scores low as it does not address office dynamics or the use of technology like earbuds. The lyrics, while poetic and rich in imagery, are somewhat hard to follow, reducing their coherence in conveying a clear, relatable message for the user's situation."
Opened the fridge and the sour-milk smell nearly knocked me over.,i woke up covered in sand it s not so ugly now i ve seen its face oh i can hear it breathing it bites my thumb i throw it at the wall i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm it didn t take too long only bout an hour in the coals we all sat down to eat it the meal was burnt i cut my gums on bone i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm and as blue as my back  i run as fast as i can couldn t scream i coughed out milk and a man i tried again and only spat out phlegm and the moon was the size of my hand,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The song lyrics chosen have a surreal and somewhat disturbing imagery that does not align well with the simple, albeit unpleasant, experience of encountering sour milk. Emotional alignment is low as the song conveys a sense of chaos and distress which is disproportionate to the emotion typically provoked by a bad smell. Contextually, the mention of 'coughed out milk' is the only slight connection to the user's experience, but it's embedded in a narrative that doesn't relate to the everyday scenario of opening a fridge. The lyrics are also somewhat incoherent, with disjointed thoughts and images that make it difficult to follow a clear narrative or emotional thread."
"I started presenting, then realized the slide on screen was upside down—facepalm moment.",for a second i realize that im holding a hollow dice and what lies before me doesn t fright a first sense of a common place the only wind that illuminates folding endlessly before my eyes,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The recommended song lyrics partially capture the emotion of embarrassment and confusion from the user's prompt, as indicated by the realization of holding 'hollow dice' and the unfolding scene. However, the song does not directly address the specific context of a presentation mishap or the humorous, self-deprecating nature of a 'facepalm moment.' The lyrics themselves are somewhat abstract and disjointed, making it difficult to fully grasp a coherent narrative or clear emotional trajectory. Therefore, while there is a slight emotional alignment, the contextual relevance and lyrical coherence are limited."

However, the song's primary theme of a spiritual journey ('riding on the J train' to the 'other side') and references to religious experiences do not closely match the sports-related context of the user's prompt. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and use a lot of colloquial expressions and interjections ('uh', 'ay', 'wha wha wha what'), which might detract from their fluency and coherence for some listeners. Overall, while the song's energy might mirror the user's excitement, its thematic focus and lyrical style are only marginally relevant to the context of attending a sports event."

Got home drenched from the rain and found a thermos of hot tea waiting on my desk—little gestures like that rescue a day.,but meanwhile downstairs i m setting up shop a little too proud to let the matter drop and i can hear you up there isn t it romantic you re huffing and puffing rearranging deck chairs on the titanic and i reach for a glass of cool water drawn from the rivers of babylon and meanwhile outside the stars have come out and the humid summer air pulls at the ring in my snout and you stand at your window looking down and i spread wide my arms jump if you want to jump jump if you want to the water s warm i know i know cause i ve been swimming blindly along through the rivers of babylon,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the emotional warmth and comfort described in the user's prompt. The emotional alignment is low because the lyrics convey a sense of conflict and tension, rather than the soothing, comforting scenario of finding a thermos of hot tea after being drenched. Contextually, the lyrics mention 'cool water' and 'humid summer air,' which contrasts with the cozy, warm setting implied by the hot tea in a rainy context. The lyrical coherence is slightly better as the lyrics maintain a certain poetic flow and imagery, though they are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making it harder to grasp a clear narrative or emotion."

The scholarship acceptance email just landed—I’m practically floating.,now i can move on to facing big girl problems no more high school drama graduated with honors and i m drinking coffee while i read the paper i ve been saving money eating only top ramen oh oh oh oh oh now i get a holiday wherever i go i might stay i don t plan on coming back ever if i can help it now i get a holiday i think i ll stay holiday think i ll stay now i get a holiday8,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song captures a sense of liberation and excitement which aligns well with the user's emotion of feeling elated about receiving a scholarship acceptance email. The mention of moving on from 'high school drama' and facing 'big girl problems' resonates with the transition from high school to a more independent phase, likely related to college or university, which is contextually relevant to the scholarship theme. However, the song's focus shifts slightly towards a more general sense of freedom and escape, which dilutes the direct relevance to the academic achievement context. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and simplistic but maintain a coherent narrative about celebrating newfound freedom and independence, which somewhat mirrors the user's current life transition."

Waiting outside the exam hall; my notes suddenly look like hieroglyphs.,in my spot the rooms go on for miles like emerald 30 racks does that resonate with you at the junction i have heard it said that those rooms are for two eyes so does it come as a surprise that ive seen it two times feeling all the things that you have tenderized the double door shuts on my step and ive seen it 2 times down in madrid well be the hound dogs on the stage eyeing northern flesh their kingdom in the snow and its yellow constitution feeling all the things that you have tenderized the double door shuts on my step and ive seen it 2 times,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the emotional state of anxiety or nervousness typically associated with waiting outside an exam hall. The lyrics are abstract and do not directly address feelings of confusion or stress about unreadable notes, which are central to the user's prompt. Contextually, the lyrics also fail to relate to the specific scenario of an exam or academic setting, instead discussing unrelated themes such as rooms, Madrid, and hound dogs. The lyrical coherence is low, as the lyrics are disjointed and difficult to follow, lacking a clear narrative or thematic consistency that might resonate with the user's situation."
The sky finally cleared after days of rain—feels like good things are coming.,i can see clearly now the rain has gone i can see all obstacles in my way gone are the dark clouds that had me blind it s going to be a bright bright sunshiny day it s going to be a bright bright sunshiny day i think i can make it now the pain has gone and all of the bad feelings have disappeared here is the rainbow i ve been praying for it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day look all around there s nothing but blue skies look straight ahead nothing but blue skies i think i can make it now the pain has gone and all of the bad feelings have disappeared i can see clearly now the rain has gone it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"The song 'I Can See Clearly Now' by Johnny Nash aligns perfectly with the user's emotional state of optimism and relief after days of rain. The lyrics directly mention the clearing of rain and the emergence of a 'bright, sunshiny day,' which mirrors the user's sentiment about good things coming. The context of weather improvement and a positive outlook is directly addressed in the song, making it highly relevant. The lyrics are clear, repetitive for emphasis, and maintain a coherent theme throughout, enhancing the listener's emotional experience."
Saw my app featured on the store’s front page—cheeks hurt from smiling.,i stopped off at the grocery store to pick up a few things and i was reaching for some cheerios when i heard someone say my name i knew exactly who it was my heart started to race i turned around my legs got weak when i saw her face there stood the girl that broke my heart just a year ago i thought that i was over her but little did i know that running into her like that would leave me in a total mess wishing that we never said goodbye and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she ran over and hugged my neck i didn t want her to let go she smiled and said i looked just like a kid with my box of cheerios we laughed and talked about old times which wasn t all that smart cause it just left me with an emptiness when she pushed away her cart and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she walked away looked back and smiled clean up on aisle five,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of happiness and pride from seeing their app featured. The song's narrative about a melancholic encounter with an ex-lover contrasts sharply with the user's joyful experience. Contextually, the song's setting in a grocery store and themes of past love and heartbreak are irrelevant to the user's situation regarding a professional achievement. The lyrics themselves are coherent and tell a clear story, but they do not match the user's prompt in terms of emotion or context."
Spent half an hour cursing the remote control until I realised I was pointing it at the wrong TV box—light-bulb moment.,i know i can never make up my mind half the time im sick just tryna find a straight light and i thought i saw the light behind your glassy narrow eyes fall fell and the weight came crashing down half the year i spent trying to relieve myself and i thought your hands were warmth something to fix my freezing form but i soon realized again it was just poor circulation and i thought i saw the light behind your glassy narrow eyes but i soon found it to be brewin slowly inside of me,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of frustration and realization, which aligns somewhat with the user's experience of frustration (cursing the remote control) and subsequent realization (light-bulb moment). However, the song's emotional tone is more intense and introspective than the light-hearted, possibly humorous frustration described in the prompt. Contextually, the song does not directly relate to the specific scenario of dealing with technology or making a simple mistake, as it delves into deeper personal and emotional struggles. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but can be perceived as disjointed and abstract, making it difficult to grasp a clear narrative or connection to the user's situation."
The vet said the tests are normal—I can finally breathe again.,ok ok you telling me to breathe but i can t catch your breath you telling me to sleep but i can bear to rest running through my blood like an animal like an animal like an animal and i need to release the energy inside me cause you make my world shake i behave like an animal like an animal like an animal like an animal like an animal ok ok ok ok like an animal like an animal2,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the user's emotional state of relief and reassurance after receiving good news from the vet. The repeated references to feeling like an 'animal' and the chaotic energy described in the lyrics contrast sharply with the calm and relieved emotions the user likely feels. The context of the song, which seems to focus on uncontrollable, wild emotions, is not relevant to the user's situation of receiving good health news about a pet. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack clear coherence, making it difficult to derive a meaningful narrative or connection to the user's emotional state."
"I laughed at his idea during the meeting, and guilt’s eating at me now.",i keep on laughing and you re keeping track and tonight i ll go back to the place i first knew that i d wait for you always on streets and in doorways where engines they die near the northeastern line and you mentioned a record that reminded me of a week that you couldn t get things out of your head i m truly sorry i missed that night it could have been the best time but it s just timing she showed up unexpected and i the train into town i put my collar down and pushed through the door but if it s smiles you want talk to the kid with the boy eyes and wake up dreaming next to him,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song's lyrics touch on themes of regret and missed opportunities, which somewhat aligns with the user's feelings of guilt. However, the connection is indirect and the song primarily focuses on other themes such as unexpected encounters and reminiscing about past events, which do not directly relate to the user's situation of feeling guilty about laughing at someone's idea. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and hard to follow, affecting their coherence. Overall, the song does not strongly match the user's emotional state or the specific context of their guilt related to a professional setting."
The empty seat at our usual café table made the coffee taste bitter today.,morning coffee tastes like there s no use for me to gettin up again and i dream your lips onto my skin i ve seen many of your future plenty of your past and i walk miles to get through you but your just a bit too fast it s a morning without you without you it s a morning without you and i can t help being greeted for you greeted for more and just an idea of the truth so take down take down all your vanity get lost with me don t you focus on reasons to leave and shakespeare and his breed they were just people like you and me so we make those ghosts disappear and if i say i wanna life for freedom oh i mean that i wanna be caught by you only morning without you i can t stand those mornings without you it s just another morning without you,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of loss and longing, which aligns well with the emotion of the user's prompt about feeling the absence of someone at a usual meeting place. The mention of 'morning coffee' and the repeated emphasis on mornings without the significant other directly connects to the user's experience of the café setting, making it contextually relevant. The lyrics, while evocative and expressive, occasionally lack a clear narrative flow and can be somewhat repetitive, which affects their coherence. Overall, the song captures the essence of missing someone in a shared, familiar space, though it could benefit from clearer lyrical structure."
Walked into the living room and everyone yelled “welcome back!”—did not see that coming.,it was a large room full of people all kinds and they had all arrived at the same building at more or less the same time and they were all free and they were all asking themselves the same question what is behind that curtain you were born and so you re free so happy birthday,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics selected have a vague connection to the theme of surprise and gathering, as it mentions a large room full of people. However, the emotional alignment is weak because the lyrics do not specifically capture the joy or surprise of a 'welcome back' scenario. The contextual relevance is low as the lyrics diverge into philosophical musings about freedom and existence, which do not directly relate to the simple, joyful context of being welcomed back unexpectedly. Lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat poetic but lack clear structure and punctuation, making them harder to follow. Overall, the song does not strongly match the user's emotional and contextual prompt."

My cat tried to pounce on its own shadow and face-planted into the rug; still chuckling.,once i laughed when i heard your saying that i d be playing solitaire uneasy in my easy chair it never entered my mind once you told me i was mistaken that i d awaken with the sun and ordered orange juice for one it never entered my mind you have what i laughed myself now i even have to scratch my back myself once you warned me that if you scorned me i d singing the maiden s prayer again and wish that you were there again to get into my hair again it never entered my mind it never entered my mind,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics primarily discuss feelings of regret and loneliness following a breakup, which does not align well with the light-hearted and amusing scenario described in the user's prompt about a cat's playful mishap. The emotional alignment score is low because the song's somber tone contrasts sharply with the user's amusement. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it does not address or relate to pets, playful incidents, or light-hearted themes, thus receiving the lowest score. The lyrical coherence is moderate as the lyrics themselves are somewhat clear and follow a consistent theme, though they are slightly repetitive and disjointed in places."
The airline lost my bag for the third time this year and acted like it wasn't a big deal.,so many took me for granted double crossed me for the bag when it landed i m thinkin you not the only fucking plug on this planet i m patient unfamiliar aircraft in sight,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's emotional alignment scores a 2 as it touches on feelings of betrayal and frustration, which can be related to the user's feelings about their lost luggage. However, the song primarily focuses on betrayal in a broader sense rather than the specific annoyance and inconvenience caused by an airline. The contextual relevance scores a 1 because the mention of 'unfamiliar aircraft' is the only slight connection to the airline context, but it doesn't directly address the issue of lost luggage. The lyrical coherence scores a 3 as the lyrics are somewhat clear but jump between ideas which might make it harder to fully grasp the intended message without more context."

This provides a high score for contextual relevance. The emotional alignment is also quite high, as the lyrics capture the sense of frustration and helplessness that can accompany such a minor yet persistent annoyance. However, the lyrical coherence of the song suffers due to repetitive phrases and a somewhat disjointed narrative that makes it difficult to follow a clear storyline or message beyond the central motif of the dripping tap. This affects the overall coherence and slightly diminishes the song's effectiveness in conveying a more structured thematic exploration."
My roommate finally started rinsing the dishes instead of piling them up—honestly proud of that progress.,yo listen i met this girl on baltic ave you can tell how she steps on boardwalk she was from park place i asked what she was doing on this side of town she said she had some taxes to pay i figured i d take a chance and advance to go and find out more about her cause there s more to know than the ways she sways and the way that she wears her clothes or the way that she plays this game so cold she said she came up rough and the one income household was not enough there d be nights she d go to sleep cold and hungry cause her mom was always short on food and money see people used to joke a lot and tease her bout her clothes not being in style dressed in dingy skirts and dirty sneakers from the finest second hand down on oriental ave but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she s got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly once she graduated jr high she started working overtime scrubbing floors or working on assembly lines just so she could help her mother out and after college they moved into marvin s garden and she got a job working at the city water department to save enough cash to move into community chest condos on pennsylvania ave she fell in love with this dude name ray who was a small time hustler from st charles place and he was known for always being in and out of trouble but the problem was that he was never on her level she argued with her mom about ray s work till he got sent upstate on the same say that she gave birth but see the baby never made it it drove her nearly crazy and she couldn t take it  but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she s got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly listen see where she came from many people find it hard just to hang on you often find them in the same place complaining instead of finding a better way of maintaining she could have balled up and cried and wished that she would die and just gave up on trying instead she grind from the bottom just to make it to the bottom now she s on top and she s flying but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly womanopoly yeah she s got it whoa yeah alright ,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song tells a story of struggle, perseverance, and eventual success, which loosely aligns with the theme of making progress in the user's prompt about their roommate. However, the emotional tone of the song, which deals with significant life challenges and overcoming adversity, is much more intense and serious compared to the light and somewhat humorous nature of the user's situation. Contextually, the song's narrative about overcoming life's hardships and achieving control doesn't directly relate to the everyday domestic scenario described in the prompt. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story, but they do not align well with the simplicity and mundane nature of the user's pride in their roommate's improved household habits."
Spent half the night checking on my pup’s fever; I’m dead tired but can’t leave his side.,you know i m tired i got a fevered brow you know i d change if i were with her now you gave me drugs you said d cure my ills they may cure yours but mine are with me still if i were with her now if i were with her now if i were with her now,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's mention of tiredness and fever aligns well with the user's emotional state of exhaustion and concern for their feverish pup, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on the themes of illness and the desire for presence and change, which resonates somewhat with the user's situation of caring for a sick pet, though the song's focus on human relationships and personal change dilutes the direct relevance. The lyrics, while evocative, are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative flow, leading to a lower score in lyrical coherence."
The app keeps saying ‘unknown error’ and I have no clue what’s actually wrong; my brain’s spinning.,i don t have any idea about what s goin on i don t have any idea about what s goin on i don t have any idea about what s goin on i don t have any idea about what s goin on i don t have any idea about what s goin on,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song's repetitive lyrics 'i don t have any idea about what s goin on' align moderately with the user's emotional state of confusion and frustration due to the 'unknown error' message. However, the song lacks depth and variation in expressing the complexity of emotions, leading to a moderate score in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song's lyrics are somewhat relevant as they echo the user's sentiment of not understanding the situation, but they do not specifically address the context of dealing with a technical issue, which limits its contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is low due to the extreme repetitiveness and lack of development or narrative progression in the lyrics, making the song less effective in providing therapeutic or substantial emotional support."
Saw a clip of glowing plankton beaches and now I’m itching to know everything about them.,i am the sand stuck under miles of rock watching the dry air sweep away my thoughts as we travel protected by shards of glass driving through the history of a million memories in a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls in a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls in a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls climbing a thousand unclimbed trees i don t know i want to know how it would feel to be on top of one of these i am the root quickly ascending up through the surrounding dirt quickly devoured by a hungry sun quickly devoured by a hungry son who is my father and we are alike we look alike we talk alike we are alike we are alike we are alike we look alike we talk alike thats why im hungry like the bellowing sky this is no lie as sure as light entering eye want to stay high everything s cool too cool so cool and i remember that everything falls so i take a look around me now as i speak and i imagine a disinterested crowd talking aloud and i think of what i want most and the crowd disappears and a fixated gaze envelopes my wondering mind and then she recruits and takes me to this place i ve been there before and that s where i saw her face in a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls in a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls in a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls climbing a thousand unclimbed trees i don t know i want to know how it would feel to be on top of one of these ,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the user's emotional state or the contextual prompt about glowing plankton beaches. The emotional alignment is low as the song's tone and themes of introspection and existential contemplation do not reflect the curiosity and wonder expressed in the user's prompt. The contextual relevance is very poor because the lyrics focus on personal and metaphorical themes rather than the natural phenomenon of glowing plankton. The lyrical coherence is also low, as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making it difficult to derive a clear and consistent message or theme. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional or contextual needs."
All morning I’ve been day-dreaming about escaping to a quiet cabin in the woods—can almost smell the pine.,lions in the street and roaming dogs in heat rabid foaming a beast caged in the heart of a city the body of his mother rotting in the summer ground he fled the town he went down south and crossed the border left chaos and disorder back there over his shoulder one morning he awoke in a green hotel with a strange creature groaning beside him sweat oozed from its shining skin is everybody in is everybody in is everybody in the ceremony is about to begin wake up you can t remember where it was had this dream stopped the snake was pale gold glazed and shrunken we were afraid to touch it the sheets were hot dead prisms and she was beside me old she s no young her dark red hair the white soft skin now run to the mirror in the bathroom look she s coming in here i can t live through each slow century of her moving i let my cheek slide down the cool smooth tile feel the good cold stinging blood the smooth hissing snakes of rain once i had a little game i liked to crawl back in my brain i think you know the game i mean i mean the game called go insane you should try this little game just close your eyes forget your name forget the world forget the people and we ll erect a different steeple this little game is fun to do just close your eyes no way to lose and i m right there i m going too release control we re breaking through way back deep into the brain back where there s never any pain and the rain falls gently on the town and over the heads of all of us and in the labyrinth of streams beneath the quiet unearthly presence of gentle hill dwellers in the gentle hills around reptiles abounding fossils caves cool air heights each house repeats a mold windows rolled beast car locked in against morning all now sleeping rugs silent mirrors vacant dust lying under the beds of lawful couples wound in sheets and daughters smug with semen eyes in their nipples wait there s been a slaughter here don t stop to speak or look around your gloves and fan are on the ground we re getting out of town we re going on the run and you re the one i want to come not to touch the earth not to see the sun nothing left to do but run run run let s run let s run house upon the hill moon is lying still shadows of the trees witnessing the wild breeze c mon baby run with me let s run run with me run with me run with me let s run the mansion is warm at the top of the hill rich are the rooms and the comforts there red are the arms of luxuriant chairs and you won t know a thing till you get inside dead president s corpse in the driver s car the engine runs on glue and tar c mon along we re not going very far to the east to meet the czar run with me run with me run with me let s run some outlaws lived by the side of the lake the minister s daughter s in love with the snake who lives in a well by the side of the road wake up girl we re almost home we should see the gates by mornin we should be inside by evening sun sun sun burn burn burn burn burn burn i will get you soon soon soon i am the lizard king i can do anything we came down the rivers and highways we came down from forests and falls we came down from carson and springfield we came down from phoenix enthralled and i can tell you the names of the kingdom i can tell you the things that you know listening for a fistful of silence climbing valleys into the shade for seven years i dwelt in the loose palace of exile playing strange games with the girls of the island now i have come again to the land of the fair and the strong and the wise brothers and sisters of the pale forest children of night who among you will run with the hunt now night arrives with her purple legion retire now to your tents and to your dreams tomorrow we enter the town of my birth i want to be ready3,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.33,"The recommended song lyrics do not align well with the user's emotional and contextual prompt. The user's prompt suggests a desire for tranquility and a serene escape to a cabin in the woods, evoking a peaceful and reflective mood. However, the song lyrics are chaotic, intense, and filled with imagery of beasts, disorder, and surreal scenarios, which starkly contrasts the calm and soothing setting the user imagines. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and difficult to follow, contributing to a low coherence score. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional state or the context of their daydream, resulting in a low overall score."
"Practised for weeks, but the open-mic night was cancelled at the last minute—total letdown.",the creators made a mistake they re unhappy with their purchase 20 years too late lost out on a trade just a wasted egg in mum s basket my brain turned out all wrong guess i wasn t quite ready give me a chemical fixer a brain elixir that kills off all self hate and the rest of me too ain t no life of the party in bed you will find me sleeping out the days i kiss goodbye to the night,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song lyrics chosen reflect a deep sense of disappointment and self-criticism, which aligns to some extent with the user's feelings of letdown. However, the intensity and nature of the lyrics, which delve into themes of self-hate and a desire for a 'chemical fixer,' overshoot the specific emotional context of a cancelled event, making it only partially aligned. Contextually, the song does not directly address the situation of preparing for a public performance or the specific type of disappointment from a cancelled event, leading to a low score in contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves, while expressive, are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative flow, affecting their coherence."
Can’t stand how people leave popcorn and cups all over the cinema floor after a movie; it really bothers me.,it took you long not to see it took me on not too see you next to me cause you re too hard to read just took a hit of ecstasy the room is spinning all around me but you re still next to to me so why else could you want to leave you said you needed to get going so you came home with me we made a bit of light love we figured we d figure it out in the morning so we ate breakfast early walking out the door is so dishonourable and sleeping on the floor is so fucking uncomfortable and a few months passed by we ran into each other at the movies and avoided eye contact you got some popcorn i got myself a berry smoothie and we entered separately but then when i sat down you were sitting right beside me and i couldn t concentrate so i said a little hey love and you continued to ignore me so i just watched the movie piranha in 3d disappointed me you re sleeping on my arm i ll cut off my numb arm but i don t have a knife so i ll gnaw off my numb arm you re sleeping on my arm i ll saw off my numb arm how did we get here these are my drunk eyes,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,"The song partially aligns with the user's emotion of frustration and annoyance, as it touches on themes of discomfort and dissatisfaction, particularly in a movie setting. However, the primary focus of the song seems to be on a dysfunctional relationship and personal distress rather than the specific annoyance of littering in a cinema. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and hard to follow, reducing their coherence and overall effectiveness in matching the user's prompt. The mention of a cinema and popcorn provides some contextual relevance, but the main narrative of the song diverges significantly from the user's concern about cleanliness and consideration in public spaces."
Stepped into the elevator and the stench of stale sweat hit me so hard it made my stomach flip.,when i crawled out of bed this morning i could tell something wasn t right there were cigarettes in the ashtrays they weren t your menthol lights there were beer bottles in the kitchen and broken glass on the floor someone must have slipped me something passed out a couple days before the car was in the carport sideways big dent running down the side never seen anything as frightening as when i took a look inside smell of musk and deception heel marks on the roof line bad music on the stereo all the seats in recline the aftermath staring me right in the face i ll get around to breaking even one of these days my credit cards have all been maxed out the meat in my freezer all thawed the irs laid the facts out it s all worse than i thought the welfare lady said enough is enough the kids ain t been to school in weeks crystal meth in the bathtub blood splattered in my sink laying around in the aftermath it s all worse than you think,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.5,"The emotional alignment of the recommended song with the user's prompt is low. The prompt describes a brief, intense moment of discomfort caused by a bad smell, whereas the song delves into a prolonged, chaotic, and distressing scenario involving substance abuse, financial ruin, and domestic disarray. The context of the song, focusing on a series of life crises, does not closely match the simple, albeit unpleasant, elevator experience described in the prompt. The lyrics themselves, while vivid and detailed, narrate a story that is far more complex and unrelated to the user's experience. However, the lyrical coherence of the song is relatively high, as it maintains a clear narrative flow and consistent thematic elements throughout."
I called the new boss ‘mom’ during the video call and wanted to crawl under my desk.,mama asked me where i went and i said i went away she asked me why i left and i told her i can t stay there s debts i gotta pay i might come back some day hopped in the back of the 95 chevy and drove it to the coast mom asked me if i got a job and i told her that i sell asked if she needed a few bucks at home and she told me go to hell and i think i might as well till then i ll surf the swell hopped in the back of the 95 chevy and drove it to the coast,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song lyrics do not align well with the user's emotional state of embarrassment and awkwardness after mistakenly calling their boss 'mom'. The song's theme revolves around leaving home, dealing with personal issues, and a strained relationship with a mother, which does not match the context of a workplace mishap. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, telling a consistent story about leaving and independence, but they do not effectively address the user's situation or emotional needs."

However, the song's primary theme of a spiritual journey on the 'J train' diverges significantly from the sports or competitive event context implied by the user's prompt, leading to a lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics, while rhythmic and repetitive, can be somewhat confusing and disjointed, especially with the frequent shifts between themes and the inclusion of phrases like 'get on the freak line,' which do not clearly relate to the rest of the song. This impacts the lyrical coherence score, as the lyrics might not fully convey a clear or consistent message to all listeners."
Walking past that abandoned lot at night makes my pulse race.,and 6 am in morningside the first car rushes by we walk down to the garden and the sunlight fills your eyes and stops me for a moment till i turn and look the other way the windows are all open and it s saturday and where i ride the evening turns to blue and fades away a silence hangs enchanted through sunset and the lane the air is charged with sunlight and your name is ringing through my mind cathedral bells and sunlit is the night,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.67,"The recommended song lyrics primarily depict serene and peaceful scenes, such as a garden in the morning light and a sunset, which contrasts sharply with the user's prompt of feeling anxious while walking past an abandoned lot at night. The emotional alignment is low because the song's mood is calm and soothing, whereas the prompt suggests a feeling of heightened alertness and fear. Contextually, the song also does not match well because it describes peaceful daily life and nature, rather than an eerie or suspenseful scenario. The lyrics themselves, while somewhat poetic, are a bit disjointed and lack a clear narrative, leading to a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
A stranger held the door while I juggled coffee and my laptop—brightened my morning.,well i woke up this morning i had something on my face it was still there when i brushed my teeth still there when i shaved i showed it to my neighbor and he broke into a grin i gave it away i gave it away smiles don t cost money give it away give it away maybe all you have is just a kind word you can say give it away give it away i woke up this morning with a song in my heart i hummed it all through coffee and it gave my day a start i took my song to work with me and i sang it for my friend don t think people do not care i know they care a lot don t be bashful of somebody give it all you ve got ,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a positive and uplifting mood, aligning well with the user's emotional state after a small act of kindness brightened their morning. The mention of 'waking up with a song in my heart' and 'hummed it all through coffee' resonates with the user's experience of a brightened morning. However, the song's broader theme of sharing happiness and kindness, while uplifting, is slightly broader than the specific context of a stranger's small act of kindness. The lyrics are coherent and fluently convey the message of spreading joy and kindness, which supports the emotional alignment and contextual relevance."
Scrolled past an old voicemail from her and suddenly the room felt empty.,i came home to an empty house surrendered my thoughts and then i passed out as the world spinning round she looked pale as she lifted off the ground and she said to me don t go don t go and she said to me don t go don t go i stood there with my jaw on the ground lost my composure but i didn t make a sound oh it s strange how we disappear one day we re just no longer here as she said to me don t go don t go and she said to me don t go don t go and she said to me1,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The recommended song captures the emotional essence of loneliness and longing, which aligns well with the user's experience of feeling the emptiness upon encountering a reminder of a past relationship. The repetition of 'don't go' resonates with the lingering attachment and the pain of separation, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song's theme of an empty house and the imagery of someone fading away fits the scenario of reminiscing about a past relationship, though it's more dramatic than the user's subtle emotional trigger. The lyrical coherence is somewhat lower due to the repetitive nature and lack of clear structure in the lyrics, which might make it harder for some listeners to follow or fully connect with the narrative."
My balcony tomatoes finally turned bright yellow today—couldn’t stop smiling.,and how i know i m happy now i jump right down the shoots of time and yes the weather was not always grey but the furrow always grazed my brow mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm now i m overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light yes we had some hard work but now it s right overcome with light overcome and my worries then were not grand but i felt them like a hammer pounding like i really feel feel them now and in a pinch i know i m dreaming mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm now i m overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light yes we had some scrapes but now it s right overcome with light overcome overcome with light overcome with light overcome,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song's repeated theme of being 'overcome with light' resonates well with the user's joy and satisfaction in seeing their tomatoes turn bright yellow, reflecting a sense of achievement and happiness. This aligns emotionally with the user's mood of being uplifted and content. However, the contextual relevance is moderate as the song's broader themes of overcoming hardships and darker times don't directly relate to the specific joy of gardening success. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and abstract, which affects their coherence, but they still convey a clear emotional message of moving from darkness to light, paralleling the transformation of the tomatoes."
He doodled a silly sketch of us on the fridge; totally melted my heart.,you looked liked pingu in the igloo your nose was cold you showed me the icicle that you found hanging from the roof i remember your entrance to the room i was in and the half pint glass you were holding that made you look bigger than you were you drew a charming stick man on my left hand and you told me not to wash it off we loved you we loved you,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The recommended song captures a tender and playful moment, similar to the user's prompt about a heartwarming sketch. The emotional alignment scores high as both the song and the prompt share a sense of affection and cherished personal moments. Contextually, the song mentions drawing on someone, which aligns with the doodling aspect of the prompt, though the settings (igloo and cold themes) diverge slightly from the simple domestic scene implied by the fridge sketch. The lyrics are somewhat poetic and maintain a good narrative flow, making them coherent and easy to follow, though they could be slightly more structured to enhance understanding."
Waiting outside the dentist’s room; my knee won’t stop bouncing.,hot blood red you ve got a hold right through my chest alarm let me catch my breath magnetic magnetic i ve waited for hours and now it s time for cake my mouth waters and my teeth ache won t wait any longer magnetic magnetic inside and inside and inside and sin inside and inside and sin and sin,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The song's emotional tone of anticipation and tension partially aligns with the user's anxiety about waiting, hence a score of 2 for emotional alignment. However, the context of the song, which seems to revolve around an intense attraction or desire (possibly metaphorical for something else like food or an event), does not closely match the specific scenario of waiting outside a dentist's office, leading to a score of 1 for contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and disjointed, lacking clear narrative or fluency, which results in a coherence score of 1. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs in this situation."
"Got a rejection email, yet somehow I feel the next interview will click.",just another face in a crowd color high thinking out loud just another day just another girl looking for a smile in angry world and i can t go home looking like this feeling this way with nothing to offer and nothing to say and it s kinda cold outside just turn me away and say that you re not hiring today cause i m down to my last 20 and i m down to my last nerve and i m hoping to find the respect i deserve but you re telling me you don t need me that s cool i ll keep walking past but my offer s still good while supplies last my self doubt enslaves me and your kind words could save me but you just won t open your mouth cause i m no hero i m no saint i m not lookin for love i m just tryin to make rent and i miss my family and i miss the way i used to be the better half of me that you simply refused to see and it s kinda cold outside you turn me away and say that you re not hiring today cause i m down to my last 20 and i m down to my last nerve and i m hoping to find the respect i deserve but you re telling me you don t need me so i guess i ll keep walking past but my offer s still good while supplies last cause i m down to my last 20 and i m down to my last nerve and i m hoping to find the respect i deserve but you re telling me you don t need me and that s cool i ll keep walking past but my offer s still good while supplies last my offer s still good while supplies last the offer s still good while supplies last my offer s still good while supplies last my offer s still good while supplies last,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,"The song captures the emotional essence of rejection and the struggle to find a place in a harsh world, aligning somewhat with the user's experience of receiving a rejection email. However, the song dwells more on despair and financial desperation, which does not completely resonate with the user's hopeful outlook towards future opportunities. Contextually, the song fits well as it deals with rejection and the search for acceptance, closely mirroring the job interview scenario. The lyrics, while expressive, are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear structure, affecting their overall coherence and fluency."
Ran my first 5 k without stopping; pretty pleased with myself.,tried to call you n got the answer phone now i m glad i m free to spend a weekend on my own do the shopping jog in the park and there s a lot of housework that needs to be done i m turning myself into a superhero of sorts and i m so happy now you didn t take my call this morning,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a positive and self-sufficient mood, aligning well with the user's feeling of accomplishment and self-satisfaction after running their first 5k. This scores high in emotional alignment. The mention of jogging in the park provides some contextual relevance to the user's activity of running. However, the broader theme of the song, which seems to focus on enjoying personal time after a missed call, diverges somewhat from the specific context of celebrating a personal athletic achievement. The lyrical coherence is somewhat low due to the disjointed nature and informal structure of the lyrics, which may affect the clarity and impact of the message."
"Realised the meeting invite said 7 a.m., not p.m.—no wonder no one joined.",i admit that i have realized i m not built for nine to fives but you know i m no good before noon so i ask myself why you decide to waste your time on a storefront s phone when you could have stayed at home sleeping in instead a choice to never leave the bed again we change the pace we count each other s debts there s forty minutes left in our day or should i say days you could have told me from the start i could have kept you safe from harm i could have left you alone you could have worked from home square one instead a choice to never leave your bed again2,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.3,"The song lyrics partially align with the emotion of frustration and confusion from the user's prompt about the mix-up in meeting times. However, the emotional intensity and specific context of the song do not fully match the lighter, somewhat humorous frustration of the user's situation. Contextually, the lyrics touch on themes of not wanting to adhere to a conventional schedule and preferring to stay at home, which loosely connects to the user's experience of a meeting time misunderstanding. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and rambling, making it difficult to follow a coherent narrative or message, thus scoring lower in lyrical coherence."
The lights flicked back on as soon as the storm ended—felt like exhaling.,alighted,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The provided song lyrics 'alighted' consist of only one word, which does not provide enough content to evaluate emotional alignment, contextual relevance, or lyrical coherence effectively. There is no clear connection to the user's prompt about the relief and change felt when a storm ends and the lights come back on. The single word does not convey any specific emotion, context, or coherent narrative related to the prompt."

The emotional tone of the song is more focused on action and resolution rather than reflecting on emptiness or change. Contextually, while both the user's situation and the song involve post-holiday scenarios, the contexts diverge significantly, with the song focusing on a theft and chase rather than the quiet aftermath of the holiday season. The lyrics themselves are coherent and tell a clear story, though they are more narrative-driven and less reflective, which does not match the user's emotional state."
Opened the fridge and found a note that read ‘road trip tomorrow!’—didn’t see that coming.,yesterday alone i laid everything out on the carpet books kitchen things objects with specific purpose or none arranged them sideways in a grid on the floor there unmoored out of context and then considered it first the whole picture then everything individually humming along at the deadest pace imaginable one object then another and then the next and i wondered what they meant there if they meant anything still found notes camping supplies a book you bought in the desert identifying wildflowers pictures from vacations from parties kitschy gifts we bought from rest stops on that road trip out west objects everything itself and then memory all of it laid out there from the dining room the living room the hallway and the basement and the kitchen from that room we called the office but never used even the bathroom everything laid out there on the floor on the carpet out of context and i sat there for hours today i moved everything from the floor to the table in the dining room placed each thing carefully without reason or at least without one i understood or could describe there on the table together and when i was done and stepped back i realized what i had made keepsakes pictures letters ordinary objects all collected there a memorial and i thought of ones on highways or set by gravestones all the things you see there but dont understand but still bring a remembered thing back vividly invoke someones reality when there together in that place in that way out of context and i knew i had to take it down before anybody else saw tomorrow i plan to put them all somewhere those things in boxes side of the road attic maybe all these things that push and pull me through history to places i once was places i mightve gone places i ended up going postcards ticket stubs from one thing or another a personalized coffee mug neither your name nor mine phone cards and old phones a page from an old calendar i bought once at a thrift store and insisted on hanging that cycles of the moon print photos old boots of mine put them in boxes and i sat there for hours in the living room first then in the dining room moving things around picking things up and seeing where they took me to what place in history what moment on our timeline where we were where i was where i thought wed end up in this house or on the highway driving somewhere near christmas in the desert or anywhere else and i put them in boxes6,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics capture a sense of unexpectedness and reflection, aligning somewhat with the emotion of surprise and anticipation in the user's prompt about an unplanned road trip. The contextual relevance is high as the lyrics mention road trips, keepsakes, and memories, which are thematically similar to the excitement and nostalgia often associated with spontaneous travel plans. However, the lyrical coherence is lower due to the stream-of-consciousness style and lack of clear structure, which might make it difficult for some listeners to follow and fully connect with the narrative."

I just finished a comedy movie and found myself laughing out loud through the entire end credits.,on my own in the back thought of death made me laugh summer s sun a sinking hole we were young and passionate we were young,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not align well with the user's emotional state of feeling amused and light-hearted after watching a comedy movie. The mention of 'death' and 'sinking hole' contrasts sharply with the joyful and carefree emotion typically associated with laughing through a comedy. Contextually, the song's themes of reflection and possibly melancholy do not match the comedic and uplifting context described by the user. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear narrative or fluency, making it difficult to fully grasp the intended message or mood of the song."
"I just returned to my desk and found my meticulously organized files shredded and scattered everywhere, and I was absolutely furious.",got me fucked up,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics 'got me fucked up' do capture a sense of frustration and anger, which aligns to some extent with the user's emotional state of being 'absolutely furious'. However, the lyrics are extremely brief and lack depth, making it difficult to fully connect with the complexity of the user's emotions and the specific context of finding their organized files destroyed. The lyrics also lack contextual relevance as they do not specifically address the situation of vandalism or the destruction of personal property. Additionally, the coherence of the lyrics is low due to their brevity and lack of detail, which does not allow for a nuanced or thorough expression of emotion or narrative."

The lyrics seem to focus on a sense of loneliness and abandonment, which does not match the user's experience of annoyance. Contextually, the mention of 'the paint was ripped off my front door' does not relate to the specific scenario of a car alarm. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative, making them only moderately coherent. Overall, the song does not effectively address the user's emotional or contextual needs."
"After staying up all night finishing that report, hearing my manager praise my work in the morning convinced me i’d made the right call.",chapter 3 the dresser learning how to think i ve always gravitated to the word enlightened it seems to be a destination in everyone s gps but what does it really mean i believe the word is solely defined by whom you ask by definition of enlightened is an individual who can control his or her thoughts i m going to share with you a method i designed years ago on my path to enlightenment you ll learn how i became the ring leader of the circus in my mind but before we get into that i must be blatantly clear i was not always living in a state of constant positivity in fact for 18 years of my life i was an extremely stubborn person known for having one hell of a bad temper as a child i spent a lot of time on my own the first portion of my life i grew up in the rural countryside of corcoran minnesota i really can t imagine a more rounded place to be raised in than minnesota growing up there i got a taste of every season at 6 30am on a cold winter morning the last thing anyone wants to do is go stand at the bus stop but we had to and furthermore we had to learn how to enjoy it we lived on a 3 acre farm house with no neighbours in sight the only people i knew that existed were my mom dad and sister my mother was a wholesome lady born and raised in the midwest my father a motorcycle riding rebel without a cause the thought of the two of them being together was something like a blizzard in july they were young and in love but my father turned out to be more unfaithful than a gas tank on e and one day he ran out not just from his wife but from his children as well they got divorced and from this point on a woman would teach me how to be a man during the ages 5 to 10 i did a lot of moving around with my mom and sister i didn t know it then but we were jumping from city to city simply to survive at the time of the divorce my mom was working in the warehouse in my dad s trucking company when the marriage ended so did her pay checks not only that but my father was doing anything he could think of to avoid paying child support she now had 2 kids no money no job no house and no partner mom was standing toe to toe with the biggest challenge of her life and refused to blink i ll never forget receiving care packages from my grandparents and eating oranges for breakfast lunch and dinner this all just added fuel to the fire she became for determined than ever to provide for her family and change our current circumstances the only thing to follow a problem is a solution eventually mom landed a great job and we relocated to bloomington minnesota this environment was very different than what i had been used to it s a very populated suburb that sits just south of minneapolis it was built off interactions and relationships with others which i had absolutely no skills at assuming it would be easy for me to make friends mom recommended i sign up for some sports at school so i began playing hockey lacrosse baseball and golf instantly i found myself surrounded by peers but instead of making friends i made them my competition at this point growing up without a father figure in my life began to affect me during practices and games i d look around and see my teammates fathers cheering them on and in some cases even coaching the team i started to realize my family situation wasn t exactly normal or similar to most of theirs since i spent so much time by myself i never learned how to take a loss i had to be the best and needed to impress and outshine others i was very hard on myself and in turn would allow these emotions to boil up until i lashed out in fits of anger episodes like this would follow me for many years at one point in school my math teacher even recommended to my mom that i get tested for bipolar disorder i wasn t in control of my emotions they were being controlled by my thoughts i was very confused and determined to fix this so i took matters into my own hands here s what i came up with inside my head sits a dresser you know the kind of dresser you keep you clothes in with top middle and bottom drawers anytime a negative or undesired thought enters my head i immediately place it in the bottom drawer and slam it shut then i open my top drawer and allow the thought erasing to begin thats where i keep all the things that can instantaneously make me happy it s like how a certain smell can trigger a memory or how a song can magically bring you back to a place and time we all have memories with past feeling that make us happy the goal is to place these memories in your top drawer the moment i open up my top drawer vibrant colours explode into the air illuminating music notes birds paintings palm trees oceans and many other beautiful sites i ve captured while travelling the world within 1 second you could completely erase any negative thoughts by simply thinking about things that make you happy the ability to let go of memories is one of the most powerful tools we possess i can honestly forget about the initial negative thought immediately and you can too over the years plenty people have told me they think i have a bad memory but these people don t understand is that i have a selective memory i choose what i want to remember if i decide to remember something i ll be able to tell you everything about that memory until my dying day chapter 4 i m selfish i really like me to say that you re dreaming right now would essentially mean no one else exists without your effort it s saying that you re solely responsible for creating everything in your life that without you the world would not exist that s exactly how you re supposed to feel i m at the top of my list and i m not afraid to admit it i m not the least bit ashamed and you shouldn t be either the word selfish has been abused and misused since its origin for some reason we ve attached a negative connotation to this misunderstood word i m here to restore it s dignity by no means am i saying you shouldn t help out others in need because in my opinion there s nothing more gratifying than being told thank you what i m saying is until you ve helped yourself you re not helping anyone else this is your life and it s time to start focussing on you the first song of mine that really caught people s attention was called no girlfriend from the outside looking in it sounds like a typical rap song about being promiscuous with a bunch of girls and not being faithful with one in particular let s take a closer look i ve always had an addictive personality to things i feel strongly about whatever caught my attention at the time i would submerge myself in it when i first saw travis barker play drums i picked up drum sticks and studied every blink 182 song when i first saw danny way air out of a half pipe i skated everyday until my shoes had no soles when i first heard eyedea freestyle i started to rhyme the same went for when i had feelings for someone the person wouldn t leave my mind for a second and if i didn t know what they were doing at all times it would drive me mad then came no girlfriend i used to record in my moms garage in bloomington one night just as i was about to shut down the computer i was hit hard with a moment of clarity i suddenly realized how significant it was to have yourself on point before you offer half of your time to someone else from here on out i wanted to spent 100 of my time focussed on me i m a very career driven individual when i understood this everything began to click i would become successful in every aspect of what i was pursuing before entering another relationship i m not saying you should push people away and become a loner what i m saying is you have the choice to spend the maximum amount of time focussed on you goals it s you call but the choice you make will be the deciding factor in how long it takes for you to get what you want the more time you spend thinking about what you want the faster you will get it i was so inspired by this wake up call that i had to immediately start writing the second i put my pen to that page it didn t stop moving until the song was completed the first sentence on that page was no girlfriend until i make a million the reference to making a million doesn t have anything to do with money rather it symbolizes a form of success in the general public s eyes within one our the song was written and recorded inside moms garage it s my right to become successful and take advantage of the years i ve been given every dream you want to pursue is waiting for you to introduce yourself now is the time to say hello the time to hesitate has passed i ve always found it interesting that you could walk into any establishment and see one thing about the employees ages old and young people all work under the same roof you could go into any fast food restaurant and notice just as many people under 40 as you do over 40 the older people are able to maintain a living and pay whatever bills they may have off the same jobs you can get as a 16 year old

emotional state of relief and satisfaction from receiving praise after hard work. The lyrics primarily discuss personal growth, overcoming childhood challenges, and self-focus, which are unrelated to the user's context of workplace achievement and validation. Additionally, the lyrics are lengthy and somewhat disjointed, making them difficult to follow, which results in a low coherence score."
"My brother felt terrible all night, so I stayed by his side and made sure he had everything he needed.",well i spent all night alone with you and you weren t even there your eyes burned on me like the midnight sun and somewhere in the night i knew how much i really cared cause you re the one you re the one for me you are the one i tried to keep my distance afraid of striking out but protect myself from life is all i ve done so i got to tell you now before another night goes by that you re the one you re the one for me you are the one and sometimes it hits you right away and sometimes it takes awhile oh but now that you ve crept up on me there s nothing i can do to stay away from you though lord i ve tried to keep it down but resistance only moves it to the front so i got to tell you now and not worry what you ll say cause you re the one you re the one for me you are the one,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.5,"The song's emotional tone of longing and realization of deep feelings does not align well with the user's prompt of caring for a sick brother, which is more about familial care and support rather than romantic affection. Contextually, the song's theme of unspoken love and personal revelation is quite distant from the user's experience of providing comfort and physical care. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent with a clear narrative about realizing and confessing one's feelings, but they do not connect well with the user's situation. Overall, the song does not effectively match the emotional or contextual needs of the user's prompt."
Receiving an urgent call from my doctor asking me to come in immediately without any details left me completely uncertain about what was wrong.,i don t know why pain has filled me it s come right in and it has drilled me in a place that used to be so pure seems like i just walk a maze that keeps me in a useless daze a state of mind that keeps me quite unsure which way should i go i say when on my bed prostrate i lay dreams begin to lure and when i wake i look around the the search for lost and found runs out my eyes to see there is no cure where s the understanding where s the love where s the realization it must be some place above ,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of uncertainty and emotional turmoil, aligning well with the user's feelings of anxiety and confusion after receiving an urgent, ambiguous call from their doctor. The mention of pain and the feeling of being 'unsure' resonate with the emotional state described in the prompt. Contextually, the song touches on themes of searching for answers and a cure, which loosely connects to the medical context of the user's situation. However, the lyrics focus more on an internal, emotional struggle rather than a specific medical scenario, which slightly limits its contextual relevance. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express a state of distress and confusion, though they are somewhat abstract and metaphorical, which might affect their direct applicability to the user's exact situation."
I just uncovered a major secret hidden in the archives and can’t stop wondering what else I’ll find.,well i was ready to walk into your heart i ll make believe there s something i ve lost but i think you know what i ve done oh i think you know i ll be your surprise it s just a secret that s alwasy on display or just a memory you can t throw away oh i ll be your surprise,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics moderately align with the emotion of uncovering secrets, as it mentions 'a secret that's always on display' and 'I think you know what I've done,' which could resonate with the feeling of discovery and the anticipation of what else might be revealed. Contextually, the song fits well with the theme of secrets and surprises, which is central to the user's experience of uncovering something hidden. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat lacking; the lyrics are a bit disjointed and vague, making it difficult to fully grasp a clear narrative or the exact nature of the secrets and surprises mentioned. This affects the overall effectiveness of the song in conveying a strong, clear message related to the user's prompt."

The lyrics repetitively focus on 'seven figure swagger' and 'loads of cheese,' which neither reflect the specific culinary activity nor the emotional tone of eager experimentation. Additionally, the lyrics lack coherence and fluency, merely repeating phrases about wealth and cheese without forming a sensible narrative or connection to the user's context of cooking a dessert."
"I opened the email to see that tonight’s concert had been canceled, leaving me utterly let down.",missed the saturday dance heard they crowded the floor i couldn t bear it without you don t get around much anymore went to visit the club i got as far as the door they d ve asked me about you don t get around much anymore well darling i guess my mind s more at ease but never the less why stir up memories i ve been invited on dates should have gone but what for it s awfully different without you don t get around much anymore,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The recommended song lyrics reflect a sense of disappointment and withdrawal from social activities, which aligns well with the user's emotion of feeling let down due to the concert cancellation. The context of missing social gatherings in the song lyrics also matches the user's situation of a canceled event. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat lower due to the lack of punctuation and fragmented structure, which might make the lyrics slightly harder to follow. Overall, the song is a good match in terms of emotional and contextual relevance but loses some points on coherence."

However, the song's intense and somewhat chaotic narrative about giving up and feeling obliterated diverges significantly from the specific context of a canceled community class, making it less relevant. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but can be difficult to follow due to their abstract and metaphorical nature, which might not directly resonate with the user's straightforward issue of communication and inclusion."

However, the emotional tone of the song is more casual and focused on solving hunger by choosing different food outlets, which doesn't deeply resonate with the discomfort and negative surprise of eating spoiled food. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack depth, affecting their coherence and relevance to the specific context of food spoilage. Overall, the song does not effectively capture the user's emotional state or the specific context of the incident."
I just waved enthusiastically at someone who wasn’t waving at me and wanted to disappear on the spot.,last night i saw someone with your eyes someone with your smile someone with your smile we danced and though glad that she had asked me to she didnt have your arms,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.5,"The song's emotional alignment with the user's prompt is low. The prompt describes a moment of embarrassment and a desire to disappear, which is not reflected in the song's themes of dancing and reminiscing about someone else's physical traits. Contextually, the song also does not match well as it deals with a romantic or nostalgic encounter rather than an awkward social mishap. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, maintaining a clear narrative about dancing with someone who resembles a past acquaintance, but they do not address the user's emotional or contextual needs."
I just found out my best friend is flying in for a surprise visit and I can’t stop smiling.,i got a big surprise when i saw you smile i never dreamed that it could be but now i realize since i saw you smile there s only happiness for me so bye bye blues bye bye blues bells ring birds sing sun is shining no more pining just we two smiling thru don t sigh don t cry bye bye blues blues,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song perfectly captures the emotion of joy and surprise, aligning well with the user's feelings about their friend's unexpected visit. The lyrics emphasize smiles, happiness, and a departure from sadness ('bye bye blues'), which resonates with the user's current joyful state. Contextually, the song fits the theme of a happy, unexpected event, enhancing the relevance to the user's situation. The lyrics are mostly coherent and fluently express the joy of a pleasant surprise, though some repetitive elements slightly affect the overall clarity. Overall, the song is an excellent match for the user's emotional and contextual needs."
"I just got word my friend is driving here through this raging thunderstorm, and each crack of thunder sent a chill down my spine.",i just looked in the mirror was that me i m older now than i used to be the sky above me lord it s turnin red there s a hard rain fallin round my head oh lord fallin round my head oh lord fallin round my head oh lord fallin round my head oh lord fallin round my head the road i m standin on it twists and turns the soles of my feet lord they re bout to burn the reaper beckons and he points the way oh lord i m gettin closer every day oh lord closer every day oh lord closer every day oh lord closer every day oh lord closer every day,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of foreboding and tension which aligns well with the user's emotional state of anxiety and fear due to the thunderstorm. The mention of a 'hard rain fallin round my head' directly connects to the stormy context, though the song seems to delve more into personal introspection and existential themes rather than focusing solely on the storm or the friend's journey, which slightly reduces its contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive, especially with the phrases 'oh lord' and 'closer every day,' which affects the lyrical coherence by making the song feel less varied and slightly monotonous, though the overall message still comes through."
"I came home after a long day to find my partner had cleaned up and cooked dinner, and it made me realize how lucky I am to have them.",last night we brought the children by to visit their grandpa and it s plain to see they re truly part of him while we were there their grandma took out some old photographs man he sure looked a lot like me back then i m seein my father in me i guess that s how it s meant to be and i find i m more and more like him each day i notice i walk the way he walks i notice i talk the way he talks i m startin to see my father in me and today i took my wife for a walk down that old dirt road where my daddy took my mom so many times and we found the time to mention things we never had before and we shared some thoughts about the family life yeah i m seein my father in me i guess that s how it s meant to be and i find i m more and more like him each day i notice i walk the way he walks i notice i talk the way he talks i m startin to see my father in me and now lookin back i can recall the times we disagreed when i could not take hold of his old fashioned ways and the more i tried to prove him wrong the more i proved him right now i know why he still stood by me when i went through that stage i m seein my father in me i guess that s how it s meant to be and i find i m more and more like him each day i notice i walk the way he walks i notice i talk the way he talks i m startin to see my father in me and i m happy to see my father in me,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,"The recommended song primarily focuses on the theme of familial resemblance and the passing down of traits from father to son, which does not closely align with the user's emotional experience of gratitude and appreciation for their partner's actions. Emotional alignment scores a 2 because there is a general sense of appreciation in the song, but it is directed towards familial relations rather than a partner. Contextual relevance scores a 1 as the song's narrative about generational legacy and reflection does not match the user's context of a partner's thoughtful actions. Lyrical coherence scores a 4 because the lyrics are clear and tell a consistent story about familial resemblance and understanding, despite not aligning well with the user's situation."
"I just found my grandmother’s favorite shawl tucked in her chair, and tears welled up as I remembered her warmth.",there s a blanket of snow covering up the old road to the house where i was raised through the window i see the lights on the tree and a glow from the old fireplace though it all looks the same so much as changed from the way it used to be christmas memories of happy years gone by they come back to me and keep me warm inside still those memories make me cry now the stockings are filled the old house is still and the kids are all dreaming away there s that old easy chair me and daddy sat there waiting for santa s sleigh now daddy has gone but we ll carry on cause the little ones still need christmas memories of happy years gone by they come back to me and keep me warm inside still those christmas memories oh they mean so much to me oh those christmas memories make me cry,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong emotional alignment with the user's prompt, as both involve reminiscing about past memories associated with a loved one and the feelings of warmth and sadness that accompany those memories. The emotional resonance is high, capturing the bittersweet nature of remembering a loved one who has passed away. Contextually, the song is somewhat relevant as it revolves around memories tied to a specific location and family, similar to the user's connection with their grandmother's shawl. However, the song specifically focuses on Christmas, which may not directly relate to the user's situation unless their memories of their grandmother are also tied to this holiday. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear narrative about family, memories, and the emotional impact of those memories, which aligns well with the user's experience of emotional reflection triggered by a physical object."
"I opened my inbox this morning to find I’d received my scholarship award, and I can’t stop grinning from ear to ear.",i think i saw ol santa through my window christmas eve my eyes were really droopy but i really do believe it must ve been ol santa cause i saw his big red hat and i know my mom and dad can t fly like that oh no and then i heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door the same ol christmas trick my dad had played since i was four he stands outside my bedroom yelling ho ho ho because he knows i don t believe in santa claus no way i think my daddy sees me peeking from my door but he pretends he s santa anyway every year he tries to fool me but i m a big boy now i don t believe in santa or his sleigh no way so i went back to my bed and i curled up nice and tight i stared out of my window and i looked into the night and then all of a sudden through my window i could see santa claus was flying by and smiling at me santa claus santa claus it must ve been ol santa claus santa claus santa claus happy ho ho ho to you and then i heard ol rudolph tellin me to come outside he told me that ol santa wanted me to take a ride i climbed out of my window and i jumped onto his sleigh and then ol santa took me up and away  we flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below i saw my big red school house and the town square picture show it was really past my bedtime and so ol santa said little boys like you should be in bed so i hollered ho ho ho and i put on santa s hat then he let me hold the reins a while we pulled up to my window and i jumped back in my room and i waved goodbye to santa with a smile when i woke up christmas morning well it was clear and bright my parents said my window had blown open in the night i smiled as i told them that it must ve been the cat and they asked me where i got my big red hat yeah yeah c mon santa claus santa claus it must ve been ol santa claus santa claus santa claus happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you one more again,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,"The recommended song revolves around a Christmas theme, focusing on a child's interaction with Santa Claus and the magic of the holiday season. This does not align with the user's emotional state of joy and accomplishment from receiving a scholarship award. The emotional alignment and contextual relevance scores are very low because the song's theme of Christmas and childhood wonder does not match the user's situation of academic achievement and adult success. However, the lyrical coherence of the song is relatively high, as the lyrics tell a clear and fluent story about a child's Christmas experience."
"I woke up this morning to find a bouquet of flowers on my nightstand with a note that said ‘just because’, and my heart melted.",at this point in my life clearly i can see all the gifts he bestowed upon me that is why deep inside i have this joy there was once a time my soul was searching to find a place to nest now in this joy i can rest now my heart holds the love he has given me and that s all that i ll ever need to live believe and spread his love i m so glad i have this joy,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a deep sense of joy and gratitude, which aligns well with the user's emotional state of feeling touched and loved upon receiving a surprise bouquet. The emotional alignment is strong as both the prompt and the song convey a heartfelt appreciation for unexpected gifts. However, the song's context focuses more on spiritual or divine gifts rather than a romantic or personal gesture, which slightly misaligns with the specific scenario of receiving flowers from a loved one. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express the theme of joy and gratitude, though they are more spiritually oriented rather than romantically, which affects the contextual relevance."
"I just sat down to record my podcast and realized I hadn’t rehearsed my opening lines, and I felt my palms grow clammy.",and i have grown i have could ve sworn i have for long i was certain that i saw it clear i am you then your sweaty palms surround it and i have grown i have could ve sworn i had but i forgot that i ever really was here heaving with all my might hear the lightning through the sky heaving with all my might hear the lightning through this for long i was certain that i saw it clear i am you than your sweaty palms surrounded but i forgot that i was ever really was here ,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,"The emotional alignment of the song with the user's prompt scores a 2, as the mention of 'sweaty palms' directly connects to the user's experience of clammy palms. However, the rest of the song does not clearly address the specific anxiety or unpreparedness the user feels. Contextually, the song scores a 1 because it seems to touch on feelings of confusion and forgetfulness, which could loosely relate to the user's situation of not rehearsing. However, the song's overall theme and setting do not align well with the context of recording a podcast. The lyrical coherence of the song is very poor, scoring a 0, as the lyrics are disjointed, repetitive, and lack a clear narrative or logical progression, making it difficult to extract a meaningful message or story. Overall, the song scores a 1 as it does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs, and the lyrics are not coherent enough to provide any substantial support or relevance."
I just watched the sunrise break through the clouds and felt sure today would bring new opportunities.,as i aimlessly wander around how could i ever expect to be found until looking down and seeing the light at the ground by my feet i heard angels resound and there i avowed this is the road i would take just to make it there for my sake now i say that i ll never break chorus i can get there by the light at my feet you ve made me walk in electricity i can get there by the light at my feet you are my everything all that i need now that i see it s so easy for me to proceed on to my destiny and let it be seen the light that you ve given thee let it be efficiently electricity you can take me there,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics align well with the user's emotional state of feeling hopeful and optimistic about new opportunities, as reflected in the mention of being guided by light and moving towards destiny. The context of a new beginning or journey is also relevant to the user's experience of watching a sunrise which symbolizes new starts. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, though the repetitive use of 'light at my feet' and 'electricity' could be seen as slightly confusing but still maintains a thematic consistency about guidance and motivation."
I just saw my project showcased in the company newsletter and couldn’t help but beam at what I’d accomplished.,i woke about nine opened up my eyes figured it s time to rise threw the curtains open wide and peeped outside yo the weather was fine i knew that was a sign that today would be a good day i popped a cd on jumped in the shower sploshed and washed till i m fresh like a flower next grab a towel and i dry myself off i grab my vest cos next it s time to get dressed i rocked white socks my fubu boxers clean white jeans and this mean white top wot zips down the side of my neck to my left shoulder blade feel like i just got paid today yeah brushed my teeth and my hair then i popped my contacts in and binned the containers put on my trainers out the front door waves hi to the neighbours oh what a glorious thing waking up in the morning baby oh what a glorious thing get to have a whole day hey so i hop on my stolen bike and ride down the kingsland road bouncing over speed bumps calves pump pedals the way i ramp that plank i desrve a frigging medal petrol fumes looms as my bike zooms stuck behind a bus wot s rough so i cough which reminds me when the sun s blistering i m gonna have to take an anti histamine or else i ll get stressed again sneeze so hard i split my vest again vex my chest till i m depressed again no way pos sis so i drop by the office check out my emails females blowing up my inbox boom soon though i m off again headed down park hook up with my peeps we kick ball till its dark then we re off to rock a show and i m super glad it s stunners time kicking dope rhymes in the summertime word,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song captures a positive and upbeat mood, aligning well with the user's feeling of pride and accomplishment as reflected in the emotional alignment score of 4. However, the song's context of a casual day enjoying good weather and hanging out with friends does not closely match the professional achievement theme of the user's prompt, leading to a contextual relevance score of 2. The lyrics are somewhat coherent with a clear narrative of enjoying a day, but the rapid shift in activities and some colloquial expressions might make it slightly harder to follow, resulting in a coherence score of 3. Overall, while the song shares the positive energy of the user's experience, its thematic focus and narrative style are only a moderate match."
"I just found an old photo of my childhood home tucked away in a drawer, and it made me realize how far I’ve come.",there s an old kodak camera in my dresser drawer i ran across it just this afternoon and i realized that i don t ever use it anymore in fact last time i did i think it was with you when we were down in cozumel we had the whole beach to ourselves and it s crazy now to think that it s all there on that film and i could take it to the store to be developed but what for i can still see everything just fine and who needs pictures with a memory like mine standing there i couldn t help but think about everything that might be on that roll i think it even has another trip we took i guess that must ve been at least three years ago when we were down in baton rouge and there wasn t much to do so we drove into new orleans every afternoon and i swear that you would think that it was only yesterday cause i can still see everything just fine who needs pictures with a memory like mine somewhere in my closet there s a cardboard box just sitting on a shelf it s full of faded memories and it s been there ever since the night you left oh just forgotten photographs to remind me of the past oh but i can still see everything just fine who needs pictures with a memory like mine yeah who needs pictures with a memory like mine,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,"The song 'Who Needs Pictures' by Brad Paisley aligns well with the user's emotional state of nostalgia and reflection upon discovering an old photo of their childhood home. The lyrics, which revolve around finding an old camera and reminiscing about past experiences captured on undeveloped film, mirror the user's experience of uncovering a memory-laden photograph. The song's theme of reflecting on the past and realizing the strength of memories over physical pictures fits perfectly with the context of the user's prompt. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear, evocative story, though some repetitive elements slightly affect the fluency. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's emotional and contextual needs, providing a reflective and nostalgic atmosphere."
"I just got the call that my test results came back clear, and I felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders.",let me down now i m falling off the line and i can feel it crawling through my spine because in my room now i feel so divine not a worry running through my mind,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song captures the emotional relief and lightness described in the user's prompt, particularly with phrases like 'not a worry running through my mind' which aligns well with the feeling of having a 'huge weight lift off my shoulders.' However, the lyrics about feeling something 'crawling through my spine' and 'falling off the line' might not perfectly fit the context of receiving good health news, as they could imply a more negative or anxious feeling. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but could be clearer in conveying a specific narrative or emotion, as the metaphors used are a bit mixed which might confuse the overall message."
I just reread the harsh message I sent my friend last night and felt a deep regret for how I spoke.,well i m sorry that you lost your shit and that s all i ve got to say about it tonight i ve thought you told me you never screamed out loud and you re proud of porno queen yes proud oh got out of bed regan it s all in your little head,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
"I just sat down for dinner and saw my father’s chair still empty, my heart ached and I can’t stop crying.",from my body out my eyes leaving my insides like the bed of ache forgotten was the story was the language never to breathe again or so it seems the surface of the earth felt like a fable after she drank up all the sea bury my father out in a church yard i have no one left to remember my name,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The recommended song lyrics resonate strongly with the emotional aspect of the user's prompt, particularly in the expression of loss and the imagery of burying a father, which aligns well with the user's experience of missing their father. This earns a high score in emotional alignment. Contextually, the lyrics are relevant as they touch on themes of loss and remembrance, which fits the dinner scene where the user feels the absence of their father. However, the song's context of a church yard burial is slightly less aligned with the immediate setting of a dinner, thus receiving a moderate score. The lyrical coherence of the song is somewhat fragmented and abstract, making it challenging to follow a clear narrative or fully grasp the intended message, which affects its coherence score."
"I just discovered a heartfelt letter from my childhood friend tucked inside an old book, and I was completely caught off guard.",i got a surprise from my honey i got a message from my girl when she picked up a pen from the side of the bed and wrote me a scribbled note that she was coming back to see me she was visiting real soon gonna get up from the long white bed and leave this cold white room wah ooo wah ooo wah ooo we would once more live together go out on a loving spree just like before the accident my baby would look at me i saw her sweet face trembling as she tried to open her eyes i jumped with the joy of a grateful boy the day my baby gave me a surprise wah ooo wah ooo wah ooo i got a surprise from my honey i got a message from my girl when she picked up a pen from the side of the bed and wrote me a scribbled note i saw her sweet face trembling as she tried to open her eyes i jumped with the joy of a grateful boy the day my baby gave me a surprise wah ooo wah ooo wah ooo,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.7,"The song captures the element of surprise and emotional impact similar to discovering an unexpected letter, which aligns moderately well with the user's emotional state. However, the context of the song, which revolves around a romantic relationship and a significant other recovering from an accident, diverges significantly from the nostalgic and platonic nature of finding a childhood friend's letter. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and simplistic but maintain a coherent narrative about receiving an unexpected message from a loved one. Overall, while there are emotional similarities, the specific details and themes do not align closely with the user's experience."
I really look up to my brother. I hope I can be like him one day.,i hope my little brother puts a call in today i hope he don t forget where he came from i hope he never has to deal with wrongin someone cause i lived with many ghosts when i was younger and i will live with many ghosts until i go i hope he s right in the head i hope he s right in the head i hope he s right in the head even if he has to wrong someone and i hope his guardian angel puts a gun in his hand if ever they get ambushed or pursued i hope she sticks around when he does dirty in this dirty duel he s brewed and though the names will get changed to protect the innocent he said i hope the names will get changed to protect me cause i lived with many ghosts when i was younger and i will live with many ghosts until i go,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,"The song lyrics reflect a complex and somewhat conflicted relationship with a brother, which partially aligns with the user's admiration for their brother but diverges significantly in tone and content. The emotional alignment is low because the song expresses more concern and worry rather than admiration and aspiration. Contextually, the song does mention a brother and hopes for him, which loosely connects to the user's prompt about their brother, but the darker themes do not match the positive outlook of the user. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, with a clear narrative thread about concern for a brother's well-being and future, though the imagery and scenarios are quite specific and might not universally resonate."
I watched this concert today and couldn’t stop laughing and smiling. It just made me feel so light and entertained.,let s sit here in the breakdown lane let s ohh and ahh until the show stops the way it makes your face light up let s have a show of hands who s enjoying themselves i know i am,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The recommended song lyrics align well emotionally with the user's experience of feeling light and entertained, as indicated by phrases like 'the way it makes your face light up' and 'who's enjoying themselves I know I am.' This reflects the joy and entertainment the user felt. Contextually, the song mentions a 'show,' which loosely connects to the user's experience at a concert, though the specific setting of a 'breakdown lane' is less relevant. The lyrical coherence is somewhat lower due to the disjointed nature of the lyrics and the lack of clear narrative or flow, making it slightly harder to follow."
I’m honestly so mad right now. I trusted someone again and they hurt me—how can people keep doing this?,don t you dare to play with my feelings i can t take it any more you spin my world around you turned me upside down i tried to stay far away from you far away from you why do you still try when you are the one to blame why do i still cry it will never be the same why do you still try when you are the one to blame why do i still cry it ll never be the same you are begging me to stay with you but you are driving me insane get out of my way and i will walk alone i don t wanna be part of your game i don t wanna be part of your game why do you still try when you are the one to blame why do i still cry it will never be the same why do you still try when you are the one to blame why do i still cry it ll never be the same ,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song chosen aligns exceptionally well with the user's emotional state of anger and betrayal. The lyrics directly address feelings of being hurt and manipulated by someone the speaker trusted, which mirrors the user's experience of being hurt by someone they trusted. Contextually, the song fits perfectly as it deals with themes of betrayal, emotional pain, and the resolve to move on, directly reflecting the user's situation. The lyrics are mostly coherent and fluently express the turmoil and resolution of the speaker, although some repetitive lines might slightly detract from the overall clarity. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's emotional and contextual needs."
"There’s this person I deal with regularly, and the way he speaks just really irritates me. I don’t know why it gets to me so much.",i m so frustrated some things are making me so sick inside aw go with your heart go with your heart yeah right quit tugging me aw i m just not good enough for you let s change let s be something we re not let s be something everybody else is ah so much built up inside it s fucking ridiculous i don t know if i should freak the fuck out on you or just sit back and laugh you want more you don t have anything me me i have everything yeah i have everything what more could i ask for nothing at all why did it have to be this way at the end why did it have to be this way at the end 1,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics strongly align with the user's feelings of frustration and irritation, as reflected in the intense emotional expression and the repeated mentions of being 'sick inside' and feeling overwhelmed ('so much built up inside'). This scores high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song relates to dealing with interpersonal conflict and emotional turmoil, which matches the user's situation of dealing with an irritating person. However, the song's context of possibly ending a relationship or a more intense confrontation doesn't perfectly align with the user's scenario of regular interaction, hence a moderate score. The lyrical coherence is somewhat low due to the chaotic and fragmented nature of the lyrics, making it harder to follow a clear narrative or message."
Someone at work has been handling things incredibly well. I just wanted to say I genuinely respect how he manages everything.,he is a mighty good god for him there s nothing to hard there is no problem he can t solve he is the lord of all in him i find no fault in him there is no failure in him i will not lack he is the lord of all in you i find no fault in you there is no failure in you i will not lack you are the lord of all you are the lord of all yes you are yes you are you are the lord of all ,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song lyrics focus on praising and acknowledging the omnipotence and perfection of a divine figure, which only loosely aligns with the emotion of respect and admiration for a colleague's management skills described in the user's prompt. The emotional alignment is low because the song attributes qualities like faultlessness and omnipotence to a deity, which is a significant departure from appreciating a human's professional capabilities. Contextually, the song is also not very relevant as it deals with spiritual or religious adoration rather than workplace competence and respect among colleagues. The lyrics themselves, while repetitive and somewhat simplistic, maintain a basic level of coherence with clear, if redundant, expressions of praise. However, they do not provide a nuanced or detailed expression suitable for the specific workplace context described."
"I’ve been taking care of a little bunny for a couple of years, and I feel so responsible for his well-being. He means a lot to me.",you know that i care what happens to you and i know that you care for me so i don t feel alone or the weight of the stone now that i ve found somewhere safe to bury my bone and any fool knows a dog needs a home a shelter from pigs on the wing,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of care and responsibility, which aligns with the user's emotional state regarding their pet bunny. The mention of caring and not feeling alone resonates with the user's feelings of attachment and responsibility. However, the song's reference to a 'dog' and 'pigs on the wing' reduces its contextual relevance to the specific situation of caring for a bunny, as these elements are not directly related to the user's experience. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, maintaining a clear narrative about needing a home and feeling supported, though the metaphorical language might obscure the direct meaning for some listeners."
I just got here and I feel completely disoriented. I don’t understand what’s going on or what I’m supposed to be doing.,well i don t know how you do this when the path were on is misleading us home well i don t know what to do kid the sun is out and i feel alive like i haven t in a long time looking backs been getting me down i m writing this for old friends that i miss to start and end things the right way gather up while i feel alive like i haven t in a long time is this a lesson in being more careful or is this a lesson in telling the truth i mapped it all out i mapped our lives out i woke up this morning and the circles were drifting apart,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.67,"The song captures a sense of disorientation and confusion, aligning somewhat with the user's emotional state of feeling lost and unsure, which is reflected in the lyrics about not knowing what to do and feeling that paths are misleading. However, the song also introduces themes of feeling alive and reconnecting with old friends, which might not directly resonate with the user's current state of confusion about their immediate environment and tasks. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, presenting a narrative of introspection and life's directions, though they can be seen as slightly disjointed in their thematic transitions. Overall, the song partially matches the user's feelings but diverges in its focus on positive rejuvenation and nostalgia."
Lately I’ve had this urge to dive into new topics and ideas—I just feel intrigued about everything around me.,just trying to sleep out on my deathbed been hungry for a week yeah i wanna go back back to the dirt i asked why do we die i asked why do we die yeah i wanna go home yeah back to the earth yeah i wanna spend my days with you spend them all with you i asked why do we die i asked why do we die yeah i m tied to all the things i ve done before yeah i m tied to all the things you ve done before yeah i think you re cool i think you re radical yeah i think you re cool i think you re radical yeah i think you re cool i think you re radical yeah i think you re cool i think you re radical i think you re radical i think you re radical2,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of curiosity and eagerness to learn. The lyrics focus on existential questions and a return to origins, which contrasts sharply with the user's forward-looking enthusiasm for new knowledge. Contextually, the song's themes of mortality and existentialism are unrelated to the user's interest in exploring new topics and ideas. The lyrical coherence is somewhat low, with repetitive phrases and a lack of clear narrative or progression, though some basic structure is present."
"More than anything right now, I just want to grow and improve. I want to become someone I can be proud of.",we can pretend who we can be a dancer in a top hat or a captain of the sea i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song lyrics score well in emotional alignment as they resonate with the user's desire to be true to themselves and to be seen for who they are, which is a fundamental part of personal growth and self-improvement. However, the song doesn't directly address the aspect of 'growth' or 'improvement' but rather focuses on self-acceptance and authenticity. Contextually, the lyrics are somewhat relevant as they touch on personal identity, which is a component of the user's goal to become someone they can be proud of. The lyrical coherence is average; the lyrics are simple and repetitive, which might limit the depth of the message but ensures clarity and easy understanding."
"I thought I could rely on someone close to me, but they let me down again. It hurts more than I expected.",i ve been so long without you i try not to think about you but i do i know that i m to blame i got no right to call your name but i do i do i m so hurt to think that you d lie to me i m hurt way down deep inside of me,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song captures the emotional essence of feeling hurt and betrayed by someone close, aligning well with the user's feelings of disappointment and pain. The lyrics express a deep sense of hurt and the difficulty of moving on, which resonates with the user's situation. Contextually, the song addresses personal emotional pain due to betrayal, which is relevant but not perfectly aligned as it seems to focus more on a romantic context rather than a general trust issue. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express the pain of betrayal, though they could delve deeper into the complexities of trust and reliance to fully match the user's experience."
"I tried to accept things the way they are, but I can’t anymore. I don’t agree with what’s happening, and I think I need to walk away.",i m breaking out these walls can t hold me any longer days pass me by and i got stronger with every breath i ever took i doubted this world as a whole i refuse to live in a world that refuses me i refuse to live a life that isn t right for me i refuse i m breaking out when reality comes i ll shove it away and try to make it to another day i refuse,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.

The lyrics express vulnerability and discomfort in social interactions, resonating with the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song touches on themes of communication and finding comfort in someone who understands, which is somewhat relevant but not directly addressing the scenario of being laughed at by others. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, with a clear expression of emotions and a narrative about finding solace in conversation with a specific person, though the poetic style might obscure some meanings."

"I had a terrifying moment recently—my whole body froze, and I felt like something horrible was about to happen.",i gotta breathe this air i gotta breathe this air and i m scared that it s poison i don t know lately i just feel like a man who s got his whole goddamn life in his hands i could bust a move i could just lay back and groove,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song captures a sense of fear and uncertainty, which aligns somewhat with the user's feeling of terror and paralysis. However, the song's focus on broader existential angst and decision-making ('i could bust a move i could just lay back and groove') diverges significantly from the specific, acute fear described in the prompt. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent theme of personal anxiety and decision-making, but they lack a clear narrative or detailed exploration of emotions. Overall, the song does not fully match the intensity and specificity of the user's described emotional experience."
"I’ve been reflecting lately, and I just feel really grateful for everything and everyone that I have in my life.",and i was telling deanna on the way over here god has blessed me with uh so many great things ability um a wonderful family and as as i was flying up here today i thought about so many different things and how i wanted to say some of the things that uh feel like i need to say but uh he gave me an opportunity to use my abilities and i seized that opportunity and i thank him for that ,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of gratitude which aligns well with the user's emotional state of feeling grateful, scoring a 4 in emotional alignment. The context of expressing thanks and acknowledging blessings fits reasonably well with the user's reflective mood on gratitude, earning a 3 in contextual relevance. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low, scoring a 2, due to the disjointed and somewhat rambling nature of the lyrics, which may detract from the overall clarity and impact of the message. The overall score is 3, indicating a moderate match to the user's prompt."
"Someone very important to me is gone, and no matter how much time passes, I still feel the weight of that loss.",i ve been so long without you i try not to think about you but i do i know that i m to blame i got no right to call your name but i do i do i m so hurt to think that you d lie to me i m hurt way down deep inside of me,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a deep sense of loss and longing, aligning well with the user's emotional state of missing someone important who is no longer present. The emotional alignment score is high because the lyrics convey a profound hurt and a persistent memory of the person, which resonates with the user's feelings. Contextually, the song fits the theme of loss, though it leans more towards a romantic angle, which may or may not completely align with the user's situation depending on the nature of their relationship with the departed. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express the pain of loss and betrayal, though the mention of being lied to introduces a specific scenario that might not universally apply to the user's experience of loss."
I've been smiling for the last three hours. I can't believe this is my life,i got a big surprise when i saw you smile i never dreamed that it could be but now i realize since i saw you smile there s only happiness for me so bye bye blues bye bye blues bells ring birds sing sun is shining no more pining just we two smiling thru don t sigh don t cry bye bye blues blues,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The recommended song lyrics align very well with the user's emotional state of continuous smiling and feeling of disbelief at their happiness. The lyrics express a transformation brought about by a smile, leading to a permanent state of happiness, which matches the user's emotional prompt perfectly, hence a score of 5 for emotional alignment. Contextually, the song fits well as it revolves around the theme of joy and a significant positive change in life, similar to the user's experience, earning a score of 4. The lyrics are coherent and follow a clear narrative of moving from a less happy state to joy due to the influence of someone's smile, though the repetitive structure and somewhat simplistic rhyming might not resonate with everyone, resulting in a score of 4 for lyrical coherence."
There’s someone I can’t stop thinking about lately. I think I’m in love with them.,she was always was talking about these crazy things that i never understood i uh word she said i all i understand that she was the girl i sat up at night thinking about in love in love in love in love in love so that s that s what i think is love when i m better cause she s here,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a strong emotional connection with someone, aligning well with the user's feelings of being in love, which scores high on emotional alignment. The context of thinking about someone and feeling in love is somewhat captured, though the lyrics are a bit disjointed and lack a clear narrative or theme beyond the general feeling of love, leading to a moderate score in contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is low due to the fragmented and somewhat confusing structure of the lyrics, making it difficult to fully grasp the storyline or the depth of emotions conveyed."
I stood in front of a huge and wasn't able to blurt out a single sentence. My knees were shaking the whole time.,i spent my night sweating through my clothes and screaming til my throat ached like burning coals still its not right now that everything i know gets caught between the gnashing teeth of the hype machine and so it goes ive never felt more alone,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.67,"The song captures a sense of intense emotional distress and physical discomfort, aligning somewhat with the user's experience of being overwhelmed and physically affected ('knees were shaking'). However, the song's focus on screaming and feeling alone due to external pressures ('gnashing teeth of the hype machine') doesn't perfectly match the user's specific scenario of being unable to speak in front of a crowd. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, though the imagery and metaphors might be confusing without more context about the 'hype machine'. Overall, the song partially aligns with the user's emotional state but lacks direct relevance to the specific context of public speaking anxiety."
I just know that tomorrow is going to be the best day ever,there s a great big beautiful tomorrow shining at the end of every day there s a great big beautiful tomorrow and tomorrow s just a dream away man has a dream and that s the start he follows his dream with mind and heart and when it becomes a reality it s a dream come true for you and me so there s a great big beautiful tomorrow shining at the end of every day there s a great big beautiful tomorrow just a dream away,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song's lyrics perfectly align with the user's emotional state of optimism and anticipation for a great day ahead, scoring a 5 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song also scores a 5 as it directly addresses the concept of looking forward to a 'great big beautiful tomorrow,' which resonates with the user's expectation of having the best day ever. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive but maintain a clear and positive message, earning a 4 in lyrical coherence. The overall score reflects a strong match between the song and the user's prompt, capturing both the emotional and thematic essence effectively."
"Today someone told me I don't belong, but I know that I must fight for my ideals and show them to the world!",well they tell me of a pie up in the sky waiting for me when i die but between the day you re born and when you die they never seem to hear even your cry because as sure as the sun will shine i m going to get my share now of what s mine the harder they come the harder they ll fall one and all the harder they come the harder they ll fall one and all well the oppressors are trying to keep me down trying to drive me underground and they think that they have got the battle won i say forgive them lord they know not what they ve done and i keep on fighting for the things i want though i know that when you re dead you can t but i d rather be a free man in my grave than living as a puppet or a slave ,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The song lyrics strongly align with the user's emotional state of feeling rejected yet determined to fight for their ideals, scoring a 5 in emotional alignment. The lyrics about fighting against oppression and refusing to be a puppet or slave resonate deeply with the user's resolve to show their worth and ideals despite opposition. Contextually, the song scores a 4 as it deals with struggle and resistance, which fits the theme of fighting for one's beliefs, although it leans more towards a broader societal struggle rather than a personal confrontation. The lyrical coherence is good, with a clear message and a consistent theme, earning a score of 4. The overall score reflects a strong match between the song and the user's emotional and contextual needs."
"After going over the situation again, something finally clicked for me. I understand now what I didn’t see before.",i realised you saw right through this and you rise always i realised you re i realised you saw right through this and you rise always what made you right and didn t i free and didn t i solve and didn t i see what made you right and didn t i free and didn t i solve and didn t i see what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right ,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song lyrics partially align with the emotional aspect of the user's prompt, which involves a realization and understanding of a previously unclear situation. The repetition of phrases like 'I realised' and 'what made you right' suggests a moment of clarity or revelation, scoring a 3 in emotional alignment. However, the song's relevance to the specific context of the user's newfound understanding is vague and not directly addressed, leading to a score of 2 in contextual relevance. The lyrics suffer significantly in coherence; the repetitive and fragmented nature makes it difficult to grasp a clear narrative or fluent expression, resulting in a score of 1. Overall, the song partially matches the emotional tone but lacks clear contextual relevance and lyrical fluency."
After today’s show I was finally able to relax for a while,i can t seem to kill my assailants they just keep changing faces i must be sleeping it all off just like you had promised so glad you could make it to a farewell until we meet again enjoy yourself just sit back and relax and start the show,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.7,"The song's emotional alignment scores a 3 as it touches on themes of relaxation and farewells, which can be associated with the user's feeling of relief after a show. However, the mention of 'assailants' and 'changing faces' introduces a sense of conflict or struggle, which doesn't perfectly align with the user's relaxed state. Contextually, the song scores a 2 because while it mentions relaxation and enjoying oneself, the overall theme seems to revolve around a more complex narrative involving conflict and farewells, which doesn't directly relate to the simple context of relaxing after a show. The lyrical coherence receives a 3 as the lyrics are somewhat clear but the connection between the ideas is slightly disjointed, making it harder to grasp a unified theme or message."
"The more I think about it, the more I realize I made a terrible mistake. I really regret what I did.",i regret leaving my soul i forgot i needed it to feel and maybe when i die i ll just grab it real quick i m coming right back i regret leaving my mind i forgot i needed it to think and maybe to keep me alive i can t believe i got so far with a head so empty but i still have eyes wait for me wait for me but i still have feet wait for me wait for me i regret leaving at all i forgot i needed god like big brother and maybe when i die yeah when i die i won t die escaping i ll die returning to the fold but i still have eyes wait for me wait for me but i still have feet wait for me wait for me but i still have faith if i ever had faith wait for me wait for me,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"The song's lyrics strongly align with the user's emotional state of regret, as evidenced by repeated mentions of regret and forgetting essential parts of oneself, which mirrors the user's realization of a mistake. The context of regret and reflection on past actions is relevant to the user's situation, though the song introduces broader existential themes that slightly deviate from the personal nature of the user's prompt. The lyrics, while evocative and thematic, can be somewhat disjointed and abstract, which may affect their coherence and the clarity of the message."
I haven’t been able to stop crying. I just feel this overwhelming sadness I don’t know how to handle.,i m sorry your situation has let you down i know that things did not go as planned because in this time you re feeling alone and sad this is what you must understand there is a way yesterday is gone it s a new day yesterday is gone my dear kay you can t get nowhere staying at home and crying you can t go on living in the past the one thing constant is that there is always change ,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics attempt to address the user's feelings of overwhelming sadness by acknowledging the situation and suggesting a perspective of change and moving forward. However, the emotional alignment scores lower because the lyrics might come across as dismissive of the user's current emotional state by quickly suggesting to move past the sadness without fully empathizing with the depth of their feelings. Contextually, the song fits as it addresses the theme of overcoming sadness, but it might not fully resonate with someone deeply entrenched in their emotions. The lyrics are coherent and follow a logical sequence, advising the listener to look beyond their current state, which is why it scores higher in lyrical coherence."
My family just told me something completely unexpected... I’m still trying to wrap my head around it.,well i was ready to walk into your heart i ll make believe there s something i ve lost but i think you know what i ve done oh i think you know i ll be your surprise it s just a secret that s alwasy on display or just a memory you can t throw away oh i ll be your surprise,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.33,"The song's lyrics suggest a theme of surprise and hidden secrets, which loosely aligns with the user's experience of receiving unexpected news. However, the emotional tone of the song, which seems to revolve around romantic intrigue or personal revelations, does not deeply resonate with the likely complex and possibly non-romantic emotions involved in the user's situation. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and cryptic, making it difficult to extract a clear narrative or emotional thread. This lack of clarity and direct relevance results in low scores for emotional alignment and lyrical coherence."
