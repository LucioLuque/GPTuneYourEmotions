Watching my teammate stay late to coach the interns after hours left me genuinely inspired.,they had been listening to our music and was inspired by what we did and just the fact that ya know big pun was covering it and getting at me to be in the video it made me feel good like a legend before my times they did that like nobody else could do that cause that was one of those classic records that was like if you touch it you gotta really know what you doing or you really mess up the ingredients and they touched it and really put they own ingredients on it to make it sound real smooth,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The recommended song lyrics discuss the impact of musical inspiration and recognition, which loosely connects to the theme of inspiration in the user's prompt. However, the emotional alignment is weak as the song focuses more on pride and legacy in a musical context rather than the selfless, mentoring inspiration described in the prompt. Contextually, the song's relevance is minimal since it revolves around music industry specifics rather than the broader, more altruistic scenario of coaching and mentoring. The lyrical coherence is slightly better as the lyrics are somewhat understandable but lack a clear, structured narrative, making it moderately difficult to follow. Overall, the song does not effectively match the emotional depth or the specific context of the user's experience."
That clip of a golden retriever chasing bubbles still has me giggling at my desk.,get back get back get back get back get back hey you why why i laugh ,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The recommended song lyrics have a repetitive structure that might mimic the playful, repetitive action of a dog chasing bubbles, which slightly aligns with the emotional tone of amusement mentioned in the prompt. However, the lyrics are minimal and lack depth, making it difficult to fully capture the joyful and lighthearted essence of the described scene. The context of the song is not clear from the lyrics provided, and they do not specifically relate to dogs, bubbles, or the specific scenario of giggling at a desk. The coherence of the lyrics is low, as they are repetitive and lack a clear narrative or fluency, making it difficult to derive a meaningful connection to the user's emotional state or the described situation."
The courier dumped my brand-new keyboard in a puddle and walked off—I'm fuming.,i m a self searching man at least i thought i was in those days i m okay i spose but still i snort up loads of cocaine they say it s down to mistrust abandonment and self hate i stare em in the eye and cry to fuck em if it felt great i struggle in myself place a bubble built around my life and if i haven t been a part of nothing in my pounding mind then fuck it i ll just sit within a grin and pick another time and distance in to mix the gin and substance in my fucking life cuz nothing knows the love inside feel it but the valve is clocked pissing out the liquids by the thousands to the fountain pots and none of your umbrellas could resist the muddy pounding drops with every dripping tear and all the shouting in this house i ve locked so try breaking in and see how far your candle burns it s pitch black forever in this mountain of abandoned words mismatching tenants in a crowded vegetated patch staring at the rusty jerrycan again now take a match one simple weed smoking alcoholic tosser one little key opens out your options proper stomp on the beat talk shit and down a vodka stop living weak own a house and see the doctor until the flames collapse i m comforting the heat i know it takes a man to stab a drunkard to his feet but i m tired the crusade of facts has played a random help but who s brain is who s mate i can t be arsed to slap myself it s never my fault i ve come to terms on my denial it seems to be the only thing to serve my custom of a smile the grief beneath the sober thing that burns enough to comfort sid before i m rich and bubbling i m eating out the fucking bin so fuck the normal way with corners i m just walking straight fuck a spoon fuck a knife i m all about the fork to face i m walking round my awkward mates that weep outside this doorstep and force stress deep inside a portion of my boring head i was pulled out with forceps i didn t wanna leave the womb i didn t wanna see the truth i didn t wanna breathe cuz it s a disgusting mistrusting dustbin we sit fucked in lusting for drug fixes fixed lost in nothing ,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The recommended song lyrics do not align well with the user's emotional state of anger and frustration due to a specific incident involving a courier and a damaged keyboard. The song's themes of self-destruction, substance abuse, and deep personal turmoil diverge significantly from the user's situation. The lyrics are chaotic and fragmented, which somewhat mirrors the user's frustration but lacks direct relevance to the incident described. The coherence of the lyrics is low, as they jump erratically between thoughts and images without a clear narrative or emotional thread that connects to the user's experience."
The elevator keeps dinging on every floor even when nobody’s inside; it’s testing my patience.,i wake to feel it all like a drum inside my chest pulled the cable from the wall but the buzzing never rests now i gotta go and you re unimpressed my choices never small and you know i never rest but you always see me fall i can t stop it cause now we re losing light i can t stop it let s sleep on it another night hours passing losing light if you re wondering let s sleep on it another night what d you come here for dodging me like a swinging door i know what you re waiting for but your patience wore out fast i gotta go and i m unimpressed my choices never small and you know i never rest and you can t catch my fall,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
My colleague refactored the legacy code and now it runs twice as fast—exactly what we needed.,we have the technology we have the technology1,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song's repeated phrase 'we have the technology' loosely aligns with the theme of technological improvement or enhancement, which is somewhat relevant to the context of refactoring code to improve performance. However, the emotional alignment is moderate as the song does not specifically capture the feelings of relief, satisfaction, or success that might be associated with the achievement described in the prompt. The lyrical coherence is low due to the repetitive and vague nature of the lyrics, which do not form a clear narrative or detailed expression."
"Let me know the moment you get home so I can relax, please.",do you want me to go i ll drive home it s alright hold the thought so tightly it was just a passing thing come inside have a seat i ll be with you soon you don t seem to have feeling turn the lights off when you leave,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The emotional alignment of the song with the user's prompt is somewhat present as the lyrics touch on themes of returning home and waiting, which indirectly relates to the user's need for reassurance when someone gets home. However, the emotional tone of the song seems more detached and ambiguous compared to the direct and caring concern expressed in the prompt. Contextually, the song mentions elements like 'driving home' and 'come inside,' which loosely fit the theme of arriving home but lack a direct connection to the user's request for notification and subsequent relaxation. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat fluent but may appear disjointed or vague in conveying a clear narrative or sentiment, which might make it harder for the user to find solace or direct relevance in them."
Why does this site have three different checkout buttons? I’m completely lost.,why oh why oh why oh why why oh why oh why because because because because goodbye goodbye goodbye why can t a bird eat an elephant why oh why oh why cause an elephant s got a pretty hard skin goodby goodbye goodbye why can t a mouse eat a streetcar why oh why oh why cause a mouse s stomach could never hold a streetcar goodbye goodbye goodbye why does a horn make music why oh why oh why cause the horn blower blows it goodbye goodbye goodbye why does a cow drink water tell me why and why because the cow gets thirsty just like you or me goodye goodbye goodbye why oh why oh why oh why why oh why oh why because because because because goodbye goodbye goodbye why won t you answer my questions why oh why oh why cause i don t know the answers goodbye goodbye goodbye why s there no pennies for ice cream why oh why oh why you put all the pennies in the telephone dear goodbye goodbye goodbye why can t a rabbit chase an eagle tell me why oh why because because why ain t my grandpa my grandma why oh why oh why same reason your dad s not your mommy goodbye goodbye goodbye why couldn t the wind blow backwards why oh why oh why cause it might backfire and hurt somebody goodbye goodbye goodbye why oh why oh why oh why why oh why oh why oh why because because because because goodbye goodbye goodbye,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The recommended song lyrics primarily consist of a series of nonsensical or whimsical questions followed by equally whimsical answers, which do not align well with the user's prompt about confusion over multiple checkout buttons. The emotional alignment is low as the song's playful tone does not match the user's likely frustration or confusion. Contextually, the song is irrelevant to the user's issue with a website interface, as it does not address technology or navigation. The lyrical coherence is also low, as the lyrics are repetitive and lack a clear, logical flow, which might further contribute to the user's sense of confusion rather than alleviating it."
I can’t stop wondering what the northern lights look like in person.,friday night and i don t have a clue just in the crowds we re dreaming as we move i wonder who we are i wonder who we are tonight and i know that someone s following me my littered face on the street the loveliest season has taken you write my name in the leaves i wonder who we are i wonder who we are tonight,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the user's emotional state or the context of their curiosity about the northern lights. The emotional alignment score is low because the lyrics reflect a sense of identity questioning and confusion, which does not directly relate to the awe or curiosity typically associated with witnessing the northern lights. The contextual relevance score is very poor as the lyrics do not mention or metaphorically relate to the northern lights, nature, or related themes. The lyrical coherence is slightly better as the lyrics maintain a consistent theme of self-reflection and questioning, though they are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making them moderately difficult to follow."
It's only Tuesday and I'm already day-dreaming about sinking into a hammock by the sea in my weekend.,well the dawn is breaking on a week of days so i best get up and be on my way grab my hat and put on my shoes but i got me a case of them monday blues them monday blues them monday blues got me a case of them monday blues well i punch the clock when the work begins but all day long i m wishing it would end i feel the same the whole week through and it s friday before i finally lose these monday blues them monday blues got me a case of them monday blues saturdays never long enough cause it s over just when i m warming up sunday comes and i m settled in then before you know it here i go again with those monday blues them monday blues got me a case of them monday blues,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song captures a sense of longing for the weekend, which aligns somewhat with the user's emotion of day-dreaming about relaxing by the sea. However, the song primarily focuses on the dread of weekdays, particularly Monday, rather than the anticipation of relaxation, which results in a lower emotional alignment score. Contextually, the song is about the weekly work grind and doesn't specifically mention or evoke imagery of a seaside or hammock, leading to a low contextual relevance score. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive but maintain a clear narrative about enduring the workweek, which supports a moderate score for lyrical coherence."
Spent a week on that proposal and it didn’t even make the meeting agenda—ouch.,appears this could not be fetched ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Since the lyrics of the recommended song could not be fetched, it is impossible to evaluate how well the song matches the user's emotional and contextual prompt. Therefore, all criteria are scored as 0, reflecting the absence of information needed to make an assessment."
My teammate keeps blaring voice notes on speaker in the open office; I swear earbuds were invented for a reason.,maybe there are cartwheels in your mouth maybe your words will grow up to be a gymnasts maybe you have been kicking people with them by accident i know some people get a whole lot of rocking in the rocking chair and the ones who dont sometimes get rocks in their voice boxes and their voice boxes become slingshots maybe you think my heart looks like a baby squirrel but you absolutely missed when you told the class i have head lice cause i one hundred percent absolutely do not have head lice and even if i do it is a fact that head lice prefer clean heads over dirty ones so i am clean as a whistle on a tea pot my mother says it is totally fine if i blow off steam as long as i speak in an octave my kindness can still reach my kindness knows mermaids never ever miss their legs in the water cause there are better ways to move through the ocean than kicking so guess what if i ever have my own team i am picking everyone first even the worst kid and the kid with the stutter like a skipping record cause i know all of us are scratched even if you cant hear it when we speak my mother says most people have heartbeats that are knocking on doors that will never open and i know my heart is a broken freezer chest cause i can never keep anything frozen so no i am not always crying i am just thawing outside of the lines and even if i am always crying it is a fact that salt is the only reason everything floats so good in the dead sea and just cause no one ever passes notes to me doesnt mean i am not super duper in fact my super duper might be a buoy or a paper boat the next time your nose gets stuck up the river cause it is a fact that our hearts stop every for a milli second every time we sneeze and some peoples houses have too much dust some peoples fathers are like attics ive heard attics have monsters in their walls and shaky stares i think if i lived in a house with attic id nightmare a burglar in my safety chest and maybe id look for rest in the sticks and stones cause my mother says a person can only swallow so much punch before hes drunk on his own fist but the only drunk i ever knew was sleeping in the alley behind our church and jesus turned water into his wine so even god has his bad days but on your bad days couldnt you just say hey im having a bad day instead of telling me im stupid or poor or telling me i dress like a boy cause maybe i am a boy and a girl maybe my name is andrea andrew so what it is a fact that bumblebees have hair on their eyes and humans also should comb though everything they see like an anchorman is not a sailor like the clouds might be a pillow fight like my mother says every bird perched on a telephone wire will listen to the conversations running through its feet to decide the direction of its flight so i know every word we speak can make hurricanes in peoples weather veins or shine their shiny shine so maybe sometime you could sit beside me on the bus and i could say guess what it is a fact that manatees have vocal chords but do not have ears and beethoven made music even when he could no longer hear and i know every belt that has hit someones back is still a belt that was built to hold something up and it is fact that egyptians slept on pillows made of stone but its not hard for me to dream that maybe one day youll write me back like the day i wrote the lightening bug to say i smashed my mason jar and i threw away the lid i didnt want to take a chance that id grow up to be a war i want to be a belly dance or an accordion or a pogo stick or the fingerprints the mason left in the mortar between the bricks to prove that he was here that he built a roof over someones head to keep the storm from their faith my mother says thats why we all were born and i think shes right so write back soon sincerely yours 1,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of frustration and annoyance caused by a teammate's behavior in an office setting. The song's lyrics are abstract and poetic, discussing various metaphorical and philosophical ideas, which do not directly address or relate to the user's specific situation about noise and personal space in a workplace. The lyrical coherence is moderate as the lyrics are somewhat fluent but may be challenging to follow due to their highly metaphorical nature and lack of clear structure. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."
Opened the fridge and the sour-milk smell nearly knocked me over.,when i crawled out of bed this morning i could tell something wasn t right there were cigarettes in the ashtrays they weren t your menthol lights there were beer bottles in the kitchen and broken glass on the floor someone must have slipped me something passed out a couple days before the car was in the carport sideways big dent running down the side never seen anything as frightening as when i took a look inside smell of musk and deception heel marks on the roof line bad music on the stereo all the seats in recline the aftermath staring me right in the face i ll get around to breaking even one of these days my credit cards have all been maxed out the meat in my freezer all thawed the irs laid the facts out it s all worse than i thought the welfare lady said enough is enough the kids ain t been to school in weeks crystal meth in the bathtub blood splattered in my sink laying around in the aftermath it s all worse than you think,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics describe a scene of chaos and neglect, which includes a variety of disturbing elements such as drugs, financial ruin, and a general sense of disaster. Emotional alignment scores low as the song conveys a much more intense and broader spectrum of negativity and distress compared to the simple disgust or surprise at a bad smell from the fridge in the user's prompt. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it does not address or relate to the specific scenario of encountering a bad smell in the fridge, instead focusing on a broader life crisis. The lyrics, while vivid and detailed, can be somewhat hard to follow due to the numerous and varied issues presented, thus earning a moderate score on lyrical coherence."
"I started presenting, then realized the slide on screen was upside down—facepalm moment.",for a second i realize that im holding a hollow dice and what lies before me doesn t fright a first sense of a common place the only wind that illuminates folding endlessly before my eyes,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song's emotional alignment scores a 2 as it captures a sense of confusion and realization, which aligns somewhat with the user's embarrassing and surprising moment. However, the song does not specifically reflect the humor or embarrassment of the situation. The contextual relevance is low, scoring a 1, because the lyrics do not directly relate to a presentation or a mistake made during a public or formal event. The lyrics are somewhat abstract and metaphorical, making them less directly applicable to the user's scenario. Lyrical coherence receives a 2 as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and cryptic, making it difficult to derive a clear and fluent meaning from them. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs for the described situation."

However, the song's primary theme of a spiritual journey on the 'J train' diverges significantly from the sports-related context of the user's prompt, resulting in a score of 1 for contextual relevance. The lyrics, while enthusiastic and rhythmic, can be somewhat repetitive and disjointed, leading to a coherence score of 2. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's specific situation and emotional state regarding a sports event."
Someone knocked on the door at midnight and then went silent; my heart’s racing.,i found a place in the morning light on strange land at a strange time my heart it cracked like a cherry bomb but i turned my head and i was gone i m ridin on i m ridin on tonight train station million miles down where s someone waiting for me now twelve hours supersonic sleep open my eyes for the colors deep i m ridin on i m ridin on tonight i m ridin on i m ridin on tonight,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the emotional intensity and suspense described in the user's prompt. The prompt suggests a scenario filled with tension and anxiety, which is not reflected in the song's themes of travel and movement. The lyrics focus on a journey and exploration, which does not match the static and unsettling context of someone knocking on the door at midnight. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, which affects their coherence, though they maintain a basic level of fluency. Overall, the song does not effectively capture the emotional or contextual essence of the user's described situation."
Got home drenched from the rain and found a thermos of hot tea waiting on my desk—little gestures like that rescue a day.,but meanwhile downstairs i m setting up shop a little too proud to let the matter drop and i can hear you up there isn t it romantic you re huffing and puffing rearranging deck chairs on the titanic and i reach for a glass of cool water drawn from the rivers of babylon and meanwhile outside the stars have come out and the humid summer air pulls at the ring in my snout and you stand at your window looking down and i spread wide my arms jump if you want to jump jump if you want to the water s warm i know i know cause i ve been swimming blindly along through the rivers of babylon,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the user's emotional and contextual prompt. The prompt describes a comforting, warm scenario involving a thoughtful gesture that turns around a dreary day. The song lyrics, however, depict a scene of conflict and emotional turmoil, with references to 'setting up shop,' 'huffing and puffing,' and 'rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic,' which suggests a futile or desperate effort. The mention of 'jump if you want to' and 'the water's warm' could loosely connect to the idea of warmth, but it is more metaphorical and does not capture the simple, comforting essence of the prompt. Additionally, the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making them difficult to follow, which affects their coherence."

The contextual relevance is moderate; the song captures the theme of a father's absence but does not specifically address the lingering presence or memories within a home, as mentioned in the user's prompt. The lyrical coherence is somewhat low due to repetitive lines and a somewhat disjointed narrative that can make it difficult for the listener to follow a clear story or message throughout the song."
The scholarship acceptance email just landed—I’m practically floating.,i ve been around the world in the pouring rain feeling out of place really feeling strange take me to a place where they know my name cuz i ain t met nobody that looks the same i m a fish out of water lion out of the jungle i need my peoples my peoples take me to my peoples gotta have someone gotta have someone to relate to to relate to gotta have someone gotta have someone to relate to to relate to see i been traveling been travelin forever but now that i ve found a home feels like i m in heaven see i been traveling been travelin forever but now that i m home it feels like i m in heaven see i been traveling been travelin forever but now that i found a home feels like i m in heaven feels like i m in heaven feels like i m in heaven feels like i m in heaven feels like i m in heaven heaven  travelin the world like a torn man been around the planet in a foreign land i ve seen things that i thought i d never see take me to a place where they look like me i m a lion out the jungle fish out of the ocean i need my peoples my peoples take me to my peoples just gotta have someone gotta have someone to relate to to relate to just gotta have someone gotta have someone to relate to to relate to see i been traveling been travelin forever but now that i found a home feels like i m in heaven see i been traveling been travelin forever but now that i m home feels like i m in heaven see i been travelin been travelin forever but now that i found a home feels like i m in heaven feels like i m in heaven feels like i m in heaven feels like i m in heaven feels like i m in heaven heaven feels like i m in heaven feels like i m in heaven ooh whoah ooh whoah i m in heaven oh and i m feeling right at home feeling right at home feeling right at home feeling right at home feeling right at home feeling right at home feeling like i m in heaven it s like i m in heaven it s like i m in heaven ooh whoah ooh whoah i m in heaven it s like i m in heaven ooh we oh i m in heaven it s like i m in heaven ooh we oh i m in heaven aah oh oh ya i m1,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song's repeated mentions of feeling 'like I'm in heaven' align well with the user's elated emotion of feeling like they're 'practically floating' after receiving a scholarship acceptance. This gives the song a high emotional alignment score. However, the contextual relevance is lower because the song primarily discusses themes of travel and finding a place where one belongs, which doesn't directly relate to the specific context of receiving a scholarship. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative structure, which affects their coherence, but they are still understandable and convey a consistent theme of joy and belonging."
"She slipped a note into my lunchbox that read “you’ve got this,” and my chest warmed.",she gettin it,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
Waiting outside the exam hall; my notes suddenly look like hieroglyphs.,i found a place in the morning light on strange land at a strange time my heart it cracked like a cherry bomb but i turned my head and i was gone i m ridin on i m ridin on tonight train station million miles down where s someone waiting for me now twelve hours supersonic sleep open my eyes for the colors deep i m ridin on i m ridin on tonight i m ridin on i m ridin on tonight,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song's emotional tone of escape and movement ('ridin on tonight') partially aligns with the anxiety and urgency implied in the user's prompt about waiting outside an exam hall. However, it lacks a direct reflection of the stress or nervousness about the impending exam, focusing instead on a broader sense of departure and travel. Contextually, the song's themes of travel and movement ('train station million miles down') are not relevant to the specific scenario of preparing for an exam, which involves mental preparation and stationary anticipation rather than physical movement. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but disjointed, with repetitive phrases and a lack of clear narrative or progression, which makes them only moderately easy to follow."
The sky finally cleared after days of rain—feels like good things are coming.,i can see clearly now the rain has gone i can see all obstacles in my way gone are the dark clouds that had me blind it s going to be a bright bright sunshiny day it s going to be a bright bright sunshiny day i think i can make it now the pain has gone and all of the bad feelings have disappeared here is the rainbow i ve been praying for it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day look all around there s nothing but blue skies look straight ahead nothing but blue skies i think i can make it now the pain has gone and all of the bad feelings have disappeared i can see clearly now the rain has gone it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day it s gonna be a bright bright sunshiny day,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song 'I Can See Clearly Now' by Johnny Nash aligns perfectly with the user's emotional state of optimism and relief after days of rain, as it talks about the clarity and brightness following the disappearance of rain. The lyrics directly mention the clearing of rain and the emergence of a 'bright, sunshiny day,' which matches the user's feeling that 'good things are coming.' The song's context of overcoming darkness and seeing clear skies is highly relevant to the user's situation. The lyrics are coherent and follow a clear, repetitive structure that emphasizes the positive change in weather and mood, though the repetition might slightly affect the lyrical variety."
Saw my app featured on the store’s front page—cheeks hurt from smiling.,i stopped off at the grocery store to pick up a few things and i was reaching for some cheerios when i heard someone say my name i knew exactly who it was my heart started to race i turned around my legs got weak when i saw her face there stood the girl that broke my heart just a year ago i thought that i was over her but little did i know that running into her like that would leave me in a total mess wishing that we never said goodbye and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she ran over and hugged my neck i didn t want her to let go she smiled and said i looked just like a kid with my box of cheerios we laughed and talked about old times which wasn t all that smart cause it just left me with an emptiness when she pushed away her cart and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she walked away looked back and smiled clean up on aisle five,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of happiness and pride from seeing their app featured. The song's narrative about a melancholic encounter with an ex-lover contrasts sharply with the user's joyful experience. Contextually, the song's setting in a grocery store and themes of past love and heartbreak are irrelevant to the user's situation related to professional achievement and happiness. The lyrics themselves are coherent and tell a clear story, hence a moderate score on lyrical coherence. Overall, the song is not a suitable match for the user's current emotional and contextual state."
Spent half an hour cursing the remote control until I realised I was pointing it at the wrong TV box—light-bulb moment.,i know i can never make up my mind half the time im sick just tryna find a straight light and i thought i saw the light behind your glassy narrow eyes fall fell and the weight came crashing down half the year i spent trying to relieve myself and i thought your hands were warmth something to fix my freezing form but i soon realized again it was just poor circulation and i thought i saw the light behind your glassy narrow eyes but i soon found it to be brewin slowly inside of me,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song lyrics chosen do not align well with the user's prompt, which describes a humorous and somewhat frustrating situation followed by a realization or 'light-bulb' moment. The emotional alignment scores a 2 as the lyrics touch slightly on the theme of realization, but in a more introspective and somber tone rather than reflecting the light-hearted frustration described in the prompt. Contextually, the song scores a 1 as the lyrics primarily deal with personal introspection and emotional struggles, which doesn't fit the context of dealing with a mundane, everyday issue like the remote control scenario. The lyrical coherence is given a 2, as the lyrics, while somewhat poetic, are disjointed and difficult to follow, lacking a clear narrative or fluency that would make the message more comprehensible."
The vet said the tests are normal—I can finally breathe again.,ok ok you telling me to breathe but i can t catch your breath you telling me to sleep but i can bear to rest running through my blood like an animal like an animal like an animal and i need to release the energy inside me cause you make my world shake i behave like an animal like an animal like an animal like an animal like an animal ok ok ok ok like an animal like an animal2,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state or context. The user's prompt indicates a sense of relief and reassurance after receiving positive news from the vet, which suggests emotions such as relief, joy, or calmness. However, the song lyrics focus on themes of uncontrollable energy and animalistic behavior, which do not reflect the user's emotional state of relief or the context of receiving good health news about a pet. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack fluency, contributing to a low coherence score. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional or contextual needs."
"I laughed at his idea during the meeting, and guilt’s eating at me now.",i keep on laughing and you re keeping track and tonight i ll go back to the place i first knew that i d wait for you always on streets and in doorways where engines they die near the northeastern line and you mentioned a record that reminded me of a week that you couldn t get things out of your head i m truly sorry i missed that night it could have been the best time but it s just timing she showed up unexpected and i the train into town i put my collar down and pushed through the door but if it s smiles you want talk to the kid with the boy eyes and wake up dreaming next to him,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of regret and missed opportunities, which aligns somewhat with the user's feeling of guilt. However, the song's narrative about missed connections and reminiscing about past interactions does not directly address the specific scenario of feeling guilty about laughing at someone's idea. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear, coherent flow, making it difficult to follow the storyline or extract a clear message. This reduces its effectiveness in matching the user's emotional and contextual needs."
The empty seat at our usual café table made the coffee taste bitter today.,it was a warm summer day watching tv with a flavor ice melting in my hand watching endless summer fifty times or more with my girlfriend and the band we walked down the beach to watch the sun come up drinking a coke she let out a burp so i refilled her cup it s 3am all i hear is my air conditioning getting bored i feel so lame i ll go piss in her coffee cup again she said she s coming back but i know that she s never coming back again,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The recommended song does not align well with the emotional or contextual prompt provided. The prompt suggests a feeling of sadness and nostalgia due to an absent friend or loved one, which makes the usual setting feel different and more negative ('bitter'). However, the song lyrics depict a casual and somewhat irreverent scene of summer days, watching TV, and juvenile behavior, which does not match the somber tone of the prompt. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear, coherent narrative, further reducing their relevance and effectiveness in addressing the prompt's emotional and contextual needs."
Walked into the living room and everyone yelled “welcome back!”—did not see that coming.,it was a large room full of people all kinds and they had all arrived at the same building at more or less the same time and they were all free and they were all asking themselves the same question what is behind that curtain you were born and so you re free so happy birthday,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The recommended song lyrics touch slightly on the theme of a gathering and surprise, which aligns somewhat with the user's experience of an unexpected welcome. However, the emotional alignment is weak as the song's focus on existential questions and a broader concept of freedom and birth does not closely mirror the specific joy and surprise of being warmly welcomed back. Contextually, the song's mention of a large room full of people only superficially matches the setting of a living room welcome back scenario, lacking direct relevance to the personal and intimate nature of the event described. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but abstract, making them less directly applicable to the user's described situation."

My cat tried to pounce on its own shadow and face-planted into the rug; still chuckling.,once i laughed when i heard your saying that i d be playing solitaire uneasy in my easy chair it never entered my mind once you told me i was mistaken that i d awaken with the sun and ordered orange juice for one it never entered my mind you have what i laughed myself now i even have to scratch my back myself once you warned me that if you scorned me i d singing the maiden s prayer again and wish that you were there again to get into my hair again it never entered my mind it never entered my mind,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not align well with the user's prompt. The emotional tone of the song, which seems to reflect on lost love and personal regret, does not match the light-hearted, humorous nature of a cat's playful mishap. Contextually, the song does not relate to pets, playfulness, or minor comedic events, focusing instead on introspective and somber themes. The lyrical coherence of the song is moderate, with a clear narrative about personal reflection and consequences of a past relationship, but it does not make sense in relation to the user's story about their cat."
The airline lost my bag for the third time this year and acted like it wasn't a big deal.,well i m heading back to pack a bag to head out on the road to take away what i know is mine and i m running down and past the yellow house with joe into the breeze where no one seems to care and i m feeling the pull dragging me off again and i m feeling so small against the sky tonight well stories of an open light and every time we work ourselves up into a rage we smash and grab and pull the handle no one says but everybody wants to be the one just climbing out and i m feeling the pull dragging me off again and i m feeling so small against the big sky tonight tonight yeah and i m feeling the pull dragging me off again and i m feeling so small against the big sky tonight and i m feeling the pull dragging me on again and i m feeling so small against the big moon sky tonight tonight oh,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song captures a sense of frustration and a feeling of being overwhelmed, which aligns somewhat with the user's emotion of annoyance and helplessness due to the recurring issue with the airline. However, the song's main themes of escape and feeling insignificant against a vast backdrop do not directly address the specific context of dealing with lost luggage and unhelpful airline responses. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, presenting a clear narrative of wanting to escape and feeling small, but they are repetitive and lack direct relevance to the user's situation. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs."

The lyrics directly reference a dripping tap and the inability to turn it off, which perfectly matches the user's context, thus achieving a high score in contextual relevance. However, the lyrical coherence is lower due to repetitive phrases and a somewhat disjointed narrative that might confuse the listener, reducing the overall clarity and impact of the message."
My roommate finally started rinsing the dishes instead of piling them up—honestly proud of that progress.,yo listen i met this girl on baltic ave you can tell how she steps on boardwalk she was from park place i asked what she was doing on this side of town she said she had some taxes to pay i figured i d take a chance and advance to go and find out more about her cause there s more to know than the ways she sways and the way that she wears her clothes or the way that she plays this game so cold she said she came up rough and the one income household was not enough there d be nights she d go to sleep cold and hungry cause her mom was always short on food and money see people used to joke a lot and tease her bout her clothes not being in style dressed in dingy skirts and dirty sneakers from the finest second hand down on oriental ave but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she s got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly once she graduated jr high she started working overtime scrubbing floors or working on assembly lines just so she could help her mother out and after college they moved into marvin s garden and she got a job working at the city water department to save enough cash to move into community chest condos on pennsylvania ave she fell in love with this dude name ray who was a small time hustler from st charles place and he was known for always being in and out of trouble but the problem was that he was never on her level she argued with her mom about ray s work till he got sent upstate on the same say that she gave birth but see the baby never made it it drove her nearly crazy and she couldn t take it  but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she s got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly listen see where she came from many people find it hard just to hang on you often find them in the same place complaining instead of finding a better way of maintaining she could have balled up and cried and wished that she would die and just gave up on trying instead she grind from the bottom just to make it to the bottom now she s on top and she s flying but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly but now look at her she s got this game on lock anything that she ever wanted now she got it and i gotta say i m so proud to see that someone like her is in control womanopoly womanopoly yeah she s got it whoa yeah alright ,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's narrative of overcoming adversity and achieving control aligns somewhat with the emotion of pride mentioned in the user's prompt, hence the score of 2 for emotional alignment. However, the context of the song, which involves a detailed story of struggle, personal relationships, and socioeconomic challenges, is not very relevant to the simple domestic achievement described by the user, leading to a score of 1 for contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat coherent with a clear narrative flow, although they are complex and dense, which justifies a score of 3 for lyrical coherence. Overall, the song does not match well with the light and domestic nature of the user's prompt, leading to an overall score of 2."
Spent half the night checking on my pup’s fever; I’m dead tired but can’t leave his side.,you know i m tired i got a fevered brow you know i d change if i were with her now you gave me drugs you said d cure my ills they may cure yours but mine are with me still if i were with her now if i were with her now if i were with her now,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics resonate well with the user's emotional state of feeling 'tired' and mention of a 'fevered brow,' which aligns closely with the user's situation of dealing with a fever (albeit the user's dog's fever). However, the song's context diverges as it seems to focus more on a personal ailment and emotional distress related to a human relationship rather than the caregiving aspect towards a pet, which the user is experiencing. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative flow, reducing their coherence and making it harder to fully grasp a solid storyline or message beyond the immediate expressions of fatigue and illness."
The app keeps saying ‘unknown error’ and I have no clue what’s actually wrong; my brain’s spinning.,i don t have any idea about what s goin on i don t have any idea about what s goin on i don t have any idea about what s goin on i don t have any idea about what s goin on i don t have any idea about what s goin on,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song's repetitive lyrics 'i don t have any idea about what s goin on' align moderately with the user's emotional state of confusion and frustration due to the 'unknown error' message. However, the song lacks depth and variation in expressing the complexity of emotions, leading to a moderate score in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song's lyrics are somewhat relevant as they echo the user's lack of understanding about the situation, but they do not specifically address the context of dealing with a technical issue, which limits its contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is low due to the repetitive nature of the lyrics, which does not provide a fluent or engaging narrative, thus affecting the overall effectiveness of the song in addressing the user's emotional and contextual needs."

The emotional alignment is low because the song's theme of exploration and elevation only slightly touches on the curiosity expressed in the user's prompt. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it does not address the specific natural phenomenon of glowing plankton or any related environmental or scientific themes. The lyrical coherence is moderate; while the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and abstract, they maintain a basic fluency and sense, though they stray from providing clear or direct information."
All morning I’ve been day-dreaming about escaping to a quiet cabin in the woods—can almost smell the pine.,lions in the street and roaming dogs in heat rabid foaming a beast caged in the heart of a city the body of his mother rotting in the summer ground he fled the town he went down south and crossed the border left chaos and disorder back there over his shoulder one morning he awoke in a green hotel with a strange creature groaning beside him sweat oozed from its shining skin is everybody in is everybody in is everybody in the ceremony is about to begin wake up you can t remember where it was had this dream stopped the snake was pale gold glazed and shrunken we were afraid to touch it the sheets were hot dead prisms and she was beside me old she s no young her dark red hair the white soft skin now run to the mirror in the bathroom look she s coming in here i can t live through each slow century of her moving i let my cheek slide down the cool smooth tile feel the good cold stinging blood the smooth hissing snakes of rain once i had a little game i liked to crawl back in my brain i think you know the game i mean i mean the game called go insane you should try this little game just close your eyes forget your name forget the world forget the people and we ll erect a different steeple this little game is fun to do just close your eyes no way to lose and i m right there i m going too release control we re breaking through way back deep into the brain back where there s never any pain and the rain falls gently on the town and over the heads of all of us and in the labyrinth of streams beneath the quiet unearthly presence of gentle hill dwellers in the gentle hills around reptiles abounding fossils caves cool air heights each house repeats a mold windows rolled beast car locked in against morning all now sleeping rugs silent mirrors vacant dust lying under the beds of lawful couples wound in sheets and daughters smug with semen eyes in their nipples wait there s been a slaughter here don t stop to speak or look around your gloves and fan are on the ground we re getting out of town we re going on the run and you re the one i want to come not to touch the earth not to see the sun nothing left to do but run run run let s run let s run house upon the hill moon is lying still shadows of the trees witnessing the wild breeze c mon baby run with me let s run run with me run with me run with me let s run the mansion is warm at the top of the hill rich are the rooms and the comforts there red are the arms of luxuriant chairs and you won t know a thing till you get inside dead president s corpse in the driver s car the engine runs on glue and tar c mon along we re not going very far to the east to meet the czar run with me run with me run with me let s run some outlaws lived by the side of the lake the minister s daughter s in love with the snake who lives in a well by the side of the road wake up girl we re almost home we should see the gates by mornin we should be inside by evening sun sun sun burn burn burn burn burn burn i will get you soon soon soon i am the lizard king i can do anything we came down the rivers and highways we came down from forests and falls we came down from carson and springfield we came down from phoenix enthralled and i can tell you the names of the kingdom i can tell you the things that you know listening for a fistful of silence climbing valleys into the shade for seven years i dwelt in the loose palace of exile playing strange games with the girls of the island now i have come again to the land of the fair and the strong and the wise brothers and sisters of the pale forest children of night who among you will run with the hunt now night arrives with her purple legion retire now to your tents and to your dreams tomorrow we enter the town of my birth i want to be ready3,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not align with the user's prompt of day-dreaming about escaping to a quiet cabin in the woods. The lyrics are chaotic and intense, featuring themes of escape, disorder, and surreal experiences, which starkly contrast the serene and tranquil imagery of a cabin in the woods. The contextual relevance is also very low as the lyrics do not evoke or relate to the peaceful, natural setting the user imagines. The lyrical coherence is slightly better, as the lyrics, while complex and abstract, maintain a certain poetic flow and structure, but they are still difficult to follow due to their disjointed and surreal nature."
"Practised for weeks, but the open-mic night was cancelled at the last minute—total letdown.",i was cut open on the way down reeling from the blow and you were there on the other line in between the tears and the lightshow what a disappointment i thought there d be so much more but all this talking is driving me insane and i was told if i was to sing along forget about myself we re all the same well maybe i should change my point of view dizzy in the morning and i m shaking in the afternoon there s never no warning when it s gonna hit and i m like an earthquake when i get thinking too much everything s falling and shaking and falling through my hands well maybe i should change my point of view well all this time we have together it s desperation for everybody it s wishful thinking for the whole human race or whoever 2,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song captures the emotion of disappointment and the feeling of being let down, aligning well with the user's emotional state after the cancellation of the open-mic night. The lyrics express feelings of disillusionment and frustration, which resonate with the user's experience. However, the song's context isn't a perfect match as it doesn't specifically address the scenario of preparing for an event that gets cancelled, but rather deals with general disappointment and emotional upheaval. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, though the stream of consciousness style and abrupt shifts in imagery might make them slightly confusing, reducing their overall clarity and direct relevance to the user's specific situation."
Can’t stand how people leave popcorn and cups all over the cinema floor after a movie; it really bothers me.,my tv set makes me so upset there s a lot of people crying there s a lot of people dying on my tv set on my tv set in magazines these girls don t look that cool to me on the internet that s like the worst place yet on my tv set on my tv set it s in our heads it s in our drinks it s on the radio they re going to try to tell you what to think so put down your remote controls i m going to stand up to the things they do though i ll never really matter at all there s nothing shocking nowadays after everything i saw on my tv set on my tv set,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The song's lyrics focus on frustration with media influence and societal issues, which only slightly aligns with the user's emotion of irritation about a specific behavior in cinemas. However, the context of the song, which deals with media and societal disillusionment, does not match the user's concern about littering in cinemas. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent theme about the impact of media, but they do not address the user's specific situation or broader context of cinema etiquette."
Stepped into the elevator and the stench of stale sweat hit me so hard it made my stomach flip.,when i crawled out of bed this morning i could tell something wasn t right there were cigarettes in the ashtrays they weren t your menthol lights there were beer bottles in the kitchen and broken glass on the floor someone must have slipped me something passed out a couple days before the car was in the carport sideways big dent running down the side never seen anything as frightening as when i took a look inside smell of musk and deception heel marks on the roof line bad music on the stereo all the seats in recline the aftermath staring me right in the face i ll get around to breaking even one of these days my credit cards have all been maxed out the meat in my freezer all thawed the irs laid the facts out it s all worse than i thought the welfare lady said enough is enough the kids ain t been to school in weeks crystal meth in the bathtub blood splattered in my sink laying around in the aftermath it s all worse than you think,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song lyrics describe a scene of chaos and disarray, which aligns somewhat with the discomfort and unpleasantness described in the user's prompt about the stench in the elevator. However, the specific details and themes in the song (substance abuse, financial ruin, etc.) diverge significantly from the simple context of encountering a bad smell in an elevator. The lyrics themselves are coherent and tell a clear narrative, though they are more complex and involved than the user's situation. Overall, the song captures a general sense of distress but does not specifically or effectively match the user's brief experience with an unpleasant odor."
I called the new boss ‘mom’ during the video call and wanted to crawl under my desk.,mama asked me where i went and i said i went away she asked me why i left and i told her i can t stay there s debts i gotta pay i might come back some day hopped in the back of the 95 chevy and drove it to the coast mom asked me if i got a job and i told her that i sell asked if she needed a few bucks at home and she told me go to hell and i think i might as well till then i ll surf the swell hopped in the back of the 95 chevy and drove it to the coast,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics do not align well with the user's emotional state of embarrassment and desire to hide after mistakenly calling their boss 'mom'. The song discusses leaving home, dealing with personal issues, and a strained relationship with a mother, which does not reflect the user's situation. The context of the song, focusing on independence and travel, also does not match the office-related, momentary embarrassment described in the prompt. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear, fluent narrative, making them only moderately easy to follow."

However, the context of the song, which is more about a spiritual journey on the 'J train' (a metaphor for a religious path), does not closely match the sports or competitive finals context of the user's situation, leading to a contextual relevance score of 2. The lyrics themselves, while energetic, are somewhat repetitive and focus heavily on the metaphor of boarding a train, which might not be immediately clear or relevant to all listeners, resulting in a lyrical coherence score of 2. Overall, the song carries the right energy but doesn't perfectly fit the specific excitement and context of attending a sports final."
Walking past that abandoned lot at night makes my pulse race.,and 6 am in morningside the first car rushes by we walk down to the garden and the sunlight fills your eyes and stops me for a moment till i turn and look the other way the windows are all open and it s saturday and where i ride the evening turns to blue and fades away a silence hangs enchanted through sunset and the lane the air is charged with sunlight and your name is ringing through my mind cathedral bells and sunlit is the night,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not align well with the user's emotional state of feeling a racing pulse due to walking past an abandoned lot at night. The song's lyrics depict serene and peaceful imagery, such as a garden in the morning, sunlight, and a quiet evening, which contrasts with the user's feeling of anxiety or fear. The context of the song, focusing on peaceful daily scenes and moments of beauty, does not match the eerie or suspenseful context suggested by the user's prompt. However, the lyrics themselves are quite fluent and create a coherent narrative of tranquil daily life, hence the higher score in lyrical coherence."
A stranger held the door while I juggled coffee and my laptop—brightened my morning.,well i woke up this morning i had something on my face it was still there when i brushed my teeth still there when i shaved i showed it to my neighbor and he broke into a grin i gave it away i gave it away smiles don t cost money give it away give it away maybe all you have is just a kind word you can say give it away give it away i woke up this morning with a song in my heart i hummed it all through coffee and it gave my day a start i took my song to work with me and i sang it for my friend don t think people do not care i know they care a lot don t be bashful of somebody give it all you ve got ,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics align well emotionally with the user's prompt, capturing the uplifting and positive feeling that a small act of kindness can bring, as reflected in the lyrics about smiling and sharing kindness. Contextually, the song fits the theme of starting the day positively and sharing joy with others, though it doesn't specifically mention the act of holding a door. The lyrics are coherent and fluently convey the message of spreading happiness and kindness, though they are somewhat repetitive. Overall, the song is a good match for the user's experience of a brightened morning due to a small, kind gesture."
Scrolled past an old voicemail from her and suddenly the room felt empty.,i came home to an empty house surrendered my thoughts and then i passed out as the world spinning round she looked pale as she lifted off the ground and she said to me don t go don t go and she said to me don t go don t go i stood there with my jaw on the ground lost my composure but i didn t make a sound oh it s strange how we disappear one day we re just no longer here as she said to me don t go don t go and she said to me don t go don t go and she said to me1,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song captures the emotional essence of loneliness and loss, aligning well with the user's experience of feeling the emptiness upon encountering a reminder of a past relationship. The repeated plea 'don't go' resonates with the longing and the emotional weight of the memory, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song's theme of an empty house and the imagery of someone fading away fits the scenario of feeling a void after revisiting a past connection, though it's not a perfect match as the song introduces elements of physical departure rather than just an emotional or memory-based experience. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear structure, which might make it harder for some listeners to fully engage with the narrative of the song."
My balcony tomatoes finally turned bright yellow today—couldn’t stop smiling.,song and melodies change and change and sway but they still stay the same the songs that we sung when the dark days come are the songs that we sung when we chased them away if i ever found a pot of gold i d buy bottles untold of the nectar of the vines cause i m gonna die with a twinkle in my eye cause i sung songs spun stories loved laughed and drank wine tomorrow is another day the cats are out to play to play that old rusty spaceship wants to sail into the milky way again on a river of red red wine run run run run run run run run run run run run run let s have some fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun we ll drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink a toast to the sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun run run run run run run run run run run run run run let s have some fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun we ll drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink a toast to the sun sun sun  in summer the bushfires rage and rage and rage on such beautiful days and we fight them with water that runs through the cracks water we re desperately trying to save so i ll just live on wine and water my vines and sleep on the wind with the fires right behind and sing on the beaches and swim through the night oh we ll cry pass the wine pass the wine pass the wine tomorrow is another day the cats are out to play to play that old rusty spaceship wants to sail into the milky way again on a river of red red wine run run run run run run run run run run run run run let s have some fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun we ll drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink a toast to the sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun run run run run run run run run run run run run run let s have some fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun we ll drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink drink a toast to the sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun sun oh what a beautiful day today today s a day to celebrate grab your bucket grab your spade we re heading down to half moon bay i saw a plane go into a cloud i m drunk i m singing i m happy and loud two o clock in the arvo but hey that s allowed i m having a good time and of that i am proud cheering opa opa opa opa opa opa opa 2,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song captures a joyful and celebratory mood, aligning well with the user's happiness about their tomatoes turning yellow, scoring a 4 in emotional alignment. The mention of nature, sun, and celebration in the song provides a moderate contextual relevance to the user's gardening success, earning a 3. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low, scoring a 2, due to repetitive phrases and a somewhat disjointed narrative that might make it harder for the user to fully connect with the song's message."
He doodled a silly sketch of us on the fridge; totally melted my heart.,you looked liked pingu in the igloo your nose was cold you showed me the icicle that you found hanging from the roof i remember your entrance to the room i was in and the half pint glass you were holding that made you look bigger than you were you drew a charming stick man on my left hand and you told me not to wash it off we loved you we loved you,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song captures a tender, heartwarming emotion similar to the user's prompt about a doodle that melted their heart. The lyrics describe intimate, playful moments that align well with the emotional tone of the prompt. Contextually, the song mentions drawing on the hand, which parallels the act of doodling in the prompt, though it's not directly about a sketch on a fridge, hence a slightly lower score. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, presenting a clear narrative of affectionate, memorable interactions, though some lines might seem disconnected without more context."
Waiting outside the dentist’s room; my knee won’t stop bouncing.,hot blood red you ve got a hold right through my chest alarm let me catch my breath magnetic magnetic i ve waited for hours and now it s time for cake my mouth waters and my teeth ache won t wait any longer magnetic magnetic inside and inside and inside and sin inside and inside and sin and sin,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.33,"The song's lyrics partially capture the anxious, jittery emotion of waiting with the mention of 'alarm' and 'catch my breath,' which aligns with the user's nervousness. However, the song's focus on magnetic attraction and the sudden shift to 'time for cake' and 'teeth ache' diverges significantly from the specific context of waiting outside a dentist's room. The lyrics lack a clear narrative or thematic coherence, with repetitive phrases and disjointed transitions that do not clearly convey a consistent message or story. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional state or contextual situation."
"Got a rejection email, yet somehow I feel the next interview will click.",just another face in a crowd color high thinking out loud just another day just another girl looking for a smile in angry world and i can t go home looking like this feeling this way with nothing to offer and nothing to say and it s kinda cold outside just turn me away and say that you re not hiring today cause i m down to my last 20 and i m down to my last nerve and i m hoping to find the respect i deserve but you re telling me you don t need me that s cool i ll keep walking past but my offer s still good while supplies last my self doubt enslaves me and your kind words could save me but you just won t open your mouth cause i m no hero i m no saint i m not lookin for love i m just tryin to make rent and i miss my family and i miss the way i used to be the better half of me that you simply refused to see and it s kinda cold outside you turn me away and say that you re not hiring today cause i m down to my last 20 and i m down to my last nerve and i m hoping to find the respect i deserve but you re telling me you don t need me so i guess i ll keep walking past but my offer s still good while supplies last cause i m down to my last 20 and i m down to my last nerve and i m hoping to find the respect i deserve but you re telling me you don t need me and that s cool i ll keep walking past but my offer s still good while supplies last my offer s still good while supplies last the offer s still good while supplies last my offer s still good while supplies last my offer s still good while supplies last,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song captures the feeling of rejection and the struggle of trying to make ends meet, which aligns somewhat with the user's experience of receiving a rejection email. However, the user also expresses a hopeful outlook towards future opportunities, which the song does not reflect, as it dwells more on despair and continuous rejection. Contextually, the song fits the theme of job searching and rejection but lacks the element of optimism present in the user's prompt. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and the narrative is slightly disjointed, affecting its coherence. Overall, the song partially matches the emotional state but misses the hopeful aspect and could be more coherent."
Ran my first 5 k without stopping; pretty pleased with myself.,damn i feel good i might be a little too high girl damn i look good i might be a little too fly yeah i got money in my pocket i got a drink in my hand i feel like nothing can stop me damn i feel like the man i m on top of the world,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics reflect a strong sense of self-confidence and elation, aligning well with the user's emotion of feeling pleased with themselves after achieving a personal milestone. The emotional alignment is high as both the user's sentiment and the song's mood are uplifted and celebratory. Contextually, the song fits to some extent as it conveys a sense of triumph and success, which resonates with the user's achievement of running a 5k without stopping. However, the song's focus on appearance and material success (e.g., 'money in my pocket') slightly diverges from the purely personal and physical accomplishment described by the user. The lyrics are coherent and maintain a consistent theme of feeling unstoppable and excellent, which supports the overall message. The overall score reflects a good match, though not perfect due to slight contextual deviations."
"Realised the meeting invite said 7 a.m., not p.m.—no wonder no one joined.",i admit that i have realized i m not built for nine to fives but you know i m no good before noon so i ask myself why you decide to waste your time on a storefront s phone when you could have stayed at home sleeping in instead a choice to never leave the bed again we change the pace we count each other s debts there s forty minutes left in our day or should i say days you could have told me from the start i could have kept you safe from harm i could have left you alone you could have worked from home square one instead a choice to never leave your bed again2,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song lyrics partially align with the emotion of frustration and confusion in the user's prompt about the mix-up with the meeting time. The mention of not being good before noon and the choice to stay in bed reflect a similar sentiment of preferring comfort over early commitments. However, the song's broader theme about lifestyle choices and personal interactions dilutes its contextual relevance to the specific scenario of a meeting time misunderstanding. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, which affects their coherence and clarity, making it harder to draw a direct connection to the user's situation."
The lights flicked back on as soon as the storm ended—felt like exhaling.,alighted,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The provided song lyrics 'alighted' consist of only a single word, which does not provide enough content to evaluate emotional alignment, contextual relevance, or lyrical coherence effectively. There is no clear connection to the user's prompt about the relief and change felt when a storm ends and the lights come back on. The lyrics do not form a coherent narrative or express any emotions directly related to the user's described experience."

The user's prompt suggests a feeling of emptiness and perhaps a touch of melancholy after removing holiday decorations, which is a quiet and reflective scenario. In contrast, the song describes a lively and adventurous Christmas story involving stolen gifts and a quest to retrieve them, which is far removed from the user's situation. The song's lyrics, while telling a coherent story, do not match the emotional or contextual needs of the user, focusing instead on excitement and conflict. The lyrical coherence is moderate as the story is understandable but the narrative style and content are not relevant to the user's experience."

The emotional tone of the song is more investigative and distrustful, which contrasts sharply with the light-hearted and spontaneous nature of the prompt. Contextually, the song does not mention or relate to road trips or similar adventures, making it largely irrelevant to the scenario. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear, coherent narrative, which affects their overall fluency and sense of storytelling."
Watching my sister patiently guide my nephew through his first steps left me amazed by her dedication.,your presence amazes me your glory surrounds me when i walked in this room i felt your arms hands upon me to think how great you are still you would touch someone like me it s your mercy and grace you amaze me i marvel at your greatness incredible your faithfulness to meet you in this unexpected place seems as though i can see you face to face your presence amazes me your glory surrounds me when i walked in this room i felt your arms hands upon me to think how great you are still you would touch someone like me it s your mercy and grace it s your mercy and grace it s your mercy and grace you amaze me,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
I just finished a comedy movie and found myself laughing out loud through the entire end credits.,on my own in the back thought of death made me laugh summer s sun a sinking hole we were young and passionate we were young,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of joy and amusement after watching a comedy movie. The mention of 'death' and 'sinking hole' in the lyrics introduces a somber tone, which is contrary to the laughter and light-heartedness described in the prompt. Contextually, the song also fails to match as it seems to reflect on youth and possibly loss, which does not connect with the comedic and uplifting experience of the user. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but lack a clear narrative or fluency, making it difficult to grasp a solid storyline or theme."
"I just returned to my desk and found my meticulously organized files shredded and scattered everywhere, and I was absolutely furious.",fuck this shit i m out mm hmm fuck this shit i m out don t mind me i ma just grab my stuff and leave scuse me please fuck this shit i m out fuck this shit i m out i don t know what the fuck just happened but i don t really care i ma get the fuck up outta here fuck this shit i m out13,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.33,"The song's emotional alignment scores high as it captures the intense frustration and desire to escape a negative situation, reflecting the user's fury upon discovering their destroyed files. However, the contextual relevance is moderate because, while the song expresses a desire to leave a frustrating situation, it doesn't specifically address the workplace or the act of vandalism. The lyrical coherence is low due to the repetitive and simplistic nature of the lyrics, which lack depth and do not form a coherent narrative or detailed expression beyond the immediate reaction."
The neighbor's car alarm blaring at sunrise grated on my nerves and ruined my morning.,i tried so hard to stay strong the first time i slept alone but the paint was ripped off my front door there was no one to open it though let s talk about it pull me into your darkness there s nothing left to give away nothing left to say today today but the paint got ripped off my front door the paint was ripped off my front door the paint was ripped off my front door,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of frustration and disturbance, somewhat aligning with the user's emotional state of being annoyed by the car alarm. However, the specific context of the song, which seems to revolve around a personal emotional struggle and possibly a breakup, does not closely match the user's situation of external noise disturbance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear narrative flow, making them moderately coherent but not entirely fluent or easy to follow. Overall, the song does not effectively address the specific scenario of the user's morning being ruined by a car alarm."
"After staying up all night finishing that report, hearing my manager praise my work in the morning convinced me i’d made the right call.",chapter 3 the dresser learning how to think i ve always gravitated to the word enlightened it seems to be a destination in everyone s gps but what does it really mean i believe the word is solely defined by whom you ask by definition of enlightened is an individual who can control his or her thoughts i m going to share with you a method i designed years ago on my path to enlightenment you ll learn how i became the ring leader of the circus in my mind but before we get into that i must be blatantly clear i was not always living in a state of constant positivity in fact for 18 years of my life i was an extremely stubborn person known for having one hell of a bad temper as a child i spent a lot of time on my own the first portion of my life i grew up in the rural countryside of corcoran minnesota i really can t imagine a more rounded place to be raised in than minnesota growing up there i got a taste of every season at 6 30am on a cold winter morning the last thing anyone wants to do is go stand at the bus stop but we had to and furthermore we had to learn how to enjoy it we lived on a 3 acre farm house with no neighbours in sight the only people i knew that existed were my mom dad and sister my mother was a wholesome lady born and raised in the midwest my father a motorcycle riding rebel without a cause the thought of the two of them being together was something like a blizzard in july they were young and in love but my father turned out to be more unfaithful than a gas tank on e and one day he ran out not just from his wife but from his children as well they got divorced and from this point on a woman would teach me how to be a man during the ages 5 to 10 i did a lot of moving around with my mom and sister i didn t know it then but we were jumping from city to city simply to survive at the time of the divorce my mom was working in the warehouse in my dad s trucking company when the marriage ended so did her pay checks not only that but my father was doing anything he could think of to avoid paying child support she now had 2 kids no money no job no house and no partner mom was standing toe to toe with the biggest challenge of her life and refused to blink i ll never forget receiving care packages from my grandparents and eating oranges for breakfast lunch and dinner this all just added fuel to the fire she became for determined than ever to provide for her family and change our current circumstances the only thing to follow a problem is a solution eventually mom landed a great job and we relocated to bloomington minnesota this environment was very different than what i had been used to it s a very populated suburb that sits just south of minneapolis it was built off interactions and relationships with others which i had absolutely no skills at assuming it would be easy for me to make friends mom recommended i sign up for some sports at school so i began playing hockey lacrosse baseball and golf instantly i found myself surrounded by peers but instead of making friends i made them my competition at this point growing up without a father figure in my life began to affect me during practices and games i d look around and see my teammates fathers cheering them on and in some cases even coaching the team i started to realize my family situation wasn t exactly normal or similar to most of theirs since i spent so much time by myself i never learned how to take a loss i had to be the best and needed to impress and outshine others i was very hard on myself and in turn would allow these emotions to boil up until i lashed out in fits of anger episodes like this would follow me for many years at one point in school my math teacher even recommended to my mom that i get tested for bipolar disorder i wasn t in control of my emotions they were being controlled by my thoughts i was very confused and determined to fix this so i took matters into my own hands here s what i came up with inside my head sits a dresser you know the kind of dresser you keep you clothes in with top middle and bottom drawers anytime a negative or undesired thought enters my head i immediately place it in the bottom drawer and slam it shut then i open my top drawer and allow the thought erasing to begin thats where i keep all the things that can instantaneously make me happy it s like how a certain smell can trigger a memory or how a song can magically bring you back to a place and time we all have memories with past feeling that make us happy the goal is to place these memories in your top drawer the moment i open up my top drawer vibrant colours explode into the air illuminating music notes birds paintings palm trees oceans and many other beautiful sites i ve captured while travelling the world within 1 second you could completely erase any negative thoughts by simply thinking about things that make you happy the ability to let go of memories is one of the most powerful tools we possess i can honestly forget about the initial negative thought immediately and you can too over the years plenty people have told me they think i have a bad memory but these people don t understand is that i have a selective memory i choose what i want to remember if i decide to remember something i ll be able to tell you everything about that memory until my dying day chapter 4 i m selfish i really like me to say that you re dreaming right now would essentially mean no one else exists without your effort it s saying that you re solely responsible for creating everything in your life that without you the world would not exist that s exactly how you re supposed to feel i m at the top of my list and i m not afraid to admit it i m not the least bit ashamed and you shouldn t be either the word selfish has been abused and misused since its origin for some reason we ve attached a negative connotation to this misunderstood word i m here to restore it s dignity by no means am i saying you shouldn t help out others in need because in my opinion there s nothing more gratifying than being told thank you what i m saying is until you ve helped yourself you re not helping anyone else this is your life and it s time to start focussing on you the first song of mine that really caught people s attention was called no girlfriend from the outside looking in it sounds like a typical rap song about being promiscuous with a bunch of girls and not being faithful with one in particular let s take a closer look i ve always had an addictive personality to things i feel strongly about whatever caught my attention at the time i would submerge myself in it when i first saw travis barker play drums i picked up drum sticks and studied every blink 182 song when i first saw danny way air out of a half pipe i skated everyday until my shoes had no soles when i first heard eyedea freestyle i started to rhyme the same went for when i had feelings for someone the person wouldn t leave my mind for a second and if i didn t know what they were doing at all times it would drive me mad then came no girlfriend i used to record in my moms garage in bloomington one night just as i was about to shut down the computer i was hit hard with a moment of clarity i suddenly realized how significant it was to have yourself on point before you offer half of your time to someone else from here on out i wanted to spent 100 of my time focussed on me i m a very career driven individual when i understood this everything began to click i would become successful in every aspect of what i was pursuing before entering another relationship i m not saying you should push people away and become a loner what i m saying is you have the choice to spend the maximum amount of time focussed on you goals it s you call but the choice you make will be the deciding factor in how long it takes for you to get what you want the more time you spend thinking about what you want the faster you will get it i was so inspired by this wake up call that i had to immediately start writing the second i put my pen to that page it didn t stop moving until the song was completed the first sentence on that page was no girlfriend until i make a million the reference to making a million doesn t have anything to do with money rather it symbolizes a form of success in the general public s eyes within one our the song was written and recorded inside moms garage it s my right to become successful and take advantage of the years i ve been given every dream you want to pursue is waiting for you to introduce yourself now is the time to say hello the time to hesitate has passed i ve always found it interesting that you could walk into any establishment and see one thing about the employees ages old and young people all work under the same roof you could go into any fast food restaurant and notice just as many people under 40 as you do over 40 the older people are able to maintain a living and pay whatever bills they may have off the same jobs you can get as a 16 year old

emotional state of relief and validation after receiving praise from their manager. The lyrics focus extensively on personal growth, overcoming childhood challenges, and self-focus, which does not match the context of workplace achievement and recognition. Additionally, the lyrics are lengthy and somewhat rambling, lacking clear coherence and direct relevance to the user's situation, thus scoring low on lyrical coherence."
"My brother felt terrible all night, so I stayed by his side and made sure he had everything he needed.",help me from falling asleep i get scared when you re not standing there save me with your teeth and don t feel bad because you re all i have don t you feel bad no i m not upset don t you feel so bad,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The song's lyrics partially align with the emotional aspect of caring and being there for someone, as indicated by phrases like 'save me' and 'you're all I have.' However, the emotional intensity and the specific context of caring for a sick brother are not directly addressed, leading to a lower score in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song does not fit well with the scenario of caring for a sibling's health, as it seems to focus more on a personal emotional dependency rather than a nurturing or supportive role. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, which affects their coherence and overall fluency, making it harder to derive a clear and consistent message."
Receiving an urgent call from my doctor asking me to come in immediately without any details left me completely uncertain about what was wrong.,waiting for you to call running to the wall my seat belts on but i still don t feel safe where were you where are you isolated and pretty damn confused don t have many friends so there isn t much to do i know that i m not like all of the rest i have a red heart pumping out my chest,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song captures the emotion of uncertainty and anxiety effectively, as reflected in the lyrics 'waiting for you to call' and 'isolated and pretty damn confused,' which align well with the user's feelings of uncertainty after receiving an urgent, ambiguous call from the doctor. The mention of feeling unsafe despite precautions ('my seat belts on but i still don t feel safe') also mirrors the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song touches on themes of isolation and confusion, which are relevant but not directly tied to the medical or health context of the user's prompt. The lyrics are coherent and convey a clear emotional narrative, although they could be more polished to enhance understanding."
I just uncovered a major secret hidden in the archives and can’t stop wondering what else I’ll find.,well i was ready to walk into your heart i ll make believe there s something i ve lost but i think you know what i ve done oh i think you know i ll be your surprise it s just a secret that s alwasy on display or just a memory you can t throw away oh i ll be your surprise,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.3,"The song's lyrics somewhat align with the user's emotional state of curiosity and surprise after uncovering a major secret, as reflected in the lines 'I think you know what I've done' and 'I'll be your surprise.' This suggests a connection to discovering or revealing something unexpected, which matches the user's experience. Contextually, the song fits well with the theme of secrets and revelations, especially with phrases like 'it's just a secret that's always on display.' However, the lyrical coherence is average; the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and cryptic, which might make it harder for the user to fully connect with the song's message."
I just watched that cooking show and I’m longing to try making that chocolate soufflé tonight.,yeah i want a seven figure swagger loads of cheese mate loads of cheese double cheese i m making it this year seven figure swagger seven figure loads of cheese mate loads of cheese double cheese i m making it this year seven figure swagger seven figure loads of cheese mate loads of cheese double cheese i m making it this year seven figure swagger seven figure yeah i want a seven figure swagger loads of cheese mate loads of cheese double cheese i m making it this year seven figure swagger seven figure loads of cheese mate loads of cheese double cheese i m making it this year seven figure swagger seven figure,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of excitement and anticipation about trying to make a chocolate soufflé. The song's repeated focus on 'seven figure swagger' and 'loads of cheese' does not reflect the specific culinary activity of making a chocolate dessert. The lyrics are highly repetitive and lack fluency, making them incoherent and irrelevant to the user's context of cooking a specific dessert. Thus, the song scores low on emotional alignment, contextual relevance, and lyrical coherence."
"I opened the email to see that tonight’s concert had been canceled, leaving me utterly let down.",well i got caught in traffic and it made me miss my flight my flight and they aren t gonna have another one till tomorrow night that s right i m runnin for the train cuz i m late for work again oh no and the door slam shut just before i can get in i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it i was born too late so i never got to see jimmy hendrix he s dead i was born too late so i never got to meet sid vicious he s dead i was born too late so i never got to see ziggy stardust oh no i was born too late so i never got to see t rex i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it because i missed it i missed a ride i missed a plane i missed a light i missed a train missed my sister missed my period missed my mother missed my father missed my boyfriend missed my girlfriend i missed my period because i missed it missed it because i missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it missed it born too late born too late ,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.67,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of frustration and disappointment due to missing various events and opportunities, which aligns well with the user's emotion of feeling let down by the concert cancellation. However, the song's context of missing flights, trains, and historical figures is only somewhat relevant to the specific scenario of a canceled concert. The lyrical coherence is low; the repetitive nature and disjointed listing of missed opportunities make the lyrics hard to follow and detract from a fluent narrative."
"I just found out the community center canceled the free cooking classes without telling me, and it felt unfair that they didn’t ask for my opinion.",i remember the days that were so far gone you don t seem to feel the way i do it sucks cause when we ve gotta leave this place we re gonna miss it crazy you don t even know that you ve been distant so i made a quick decision with friends all by the door you stood there in the kitchen with your eyes fixed on the floor the logical solution you d ignore you always wanted more than this there wasn t a turning point that i could think of it was just another day where we all linked up now it s clear what s happening and i m so bummed out wasting all my energy so you might calm down but you make the same decisions and you left us at the door you re sitting in the kitchen with your eyes fixed on the floor the logical solution you d ignore you always wanted more than this,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song lyrics reflect a general sense of disappointment and feeling of being ignored, which aligns to some extent with the user's emotions of feeling unfairly treated. However, the specific context of the song, which seems to deal with personal relationships and decisions, does not closely match the user's situation regarding a community center and cooking classes. The lyrics themselves are moderately coherent, maintaining a consistent narrative about feeling let down and distant relationships, but they do not directly address the user's experience with the community center or the aspect of not being consulted, which is central to the user's emotional state."
"I just took a bite of my sandwich and realized it had gone bad, making my stomach turn.",i must have been unconscious for a while i didn t realize that i nearly died that i nearly died so i came to terms that everything was changed but i tried to touch your hand i could have tried to touch your hand with the passing glass you didn t know i felt that way and i just shrugged it off anyways so i hit a stride i thought if i had died i never would have had a chance to hold you for the first time since i almost had you didn t know i felt that way and i just shrugged it off you didn t know i felt that way and i just shrugged it off anyways ooohh you didn t know i felt that way and i just shrugged it off you didn t know i felt that way and i just shrugged it off anyways anyways anyways anyways,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics discuss a near-death experience and the subsequent realization of unspoken feelings, which does not align well with the user's experience of eating spoiled food. The emotional alignment is low because the intensity and type of distress do not match; the song's themes of regret and missed opportunities are far more intense than the discomfort of a bad sandwich. Contextually, the song is irrelevant as it does not address food, health, or minor daily mishaps. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but repetitive and vague, making it difficult to grasp a clear narrative or message."
I just waved enthusiastically at someone who wasn’t waving at me and wanted to disappear on the spot.,last night i saw someone with your eyes someone with your smile someone with your smile we danced and though glad that she had asked me to she didnt have your arms,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song captures a sense of awkwardness and mistaken identity, which aligns somewhat with the user's feeling of embarrassment. However, the song's focus on a romantic encounter and nostalgia for a past relationship does not directly address the user's specific situation of a social faux pas. The lyrics are somewhat coherent but lack a clear narrative flow, making them only moderately easy to follow. Overall, the song does not effectively match the emotional intensity or the exact context of the user's experience."
I just found out my best friend is flying in for a surprise visit and I can’t stop smiling.,i got a big surprise when i saw you smile i never dreamed that it could be but now i realize since i saw you smile there s only happiness for me so bye bye blues bye bye blues bells ring birds sing sun is shining no more pining just we two smiling thru don t sigh don t cry bye bye blues blues,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The song's lyrics perfectly capture the emotion of happiness and surprise, aligning well with the user's feelings of joy upon learning about their best friend's unexpected visit. The repeated references to smiling and happiness in the lyrics resonate strongly with the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song fits the theme of a joyful reunion, although it doesn't specifically mention a friend or a visit, which slightly lowers its contextual relevance score. The lyrics are coherent and flow well, with a clear expression of joy and the dismissal of sadness, though the simplicity and repetitiveness slightly affect the lyrical coherence score. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's emotional and contextual needs."
"I just got word my friend is driving here through this raging thunderstorm, and each crack of thunder sent a chill down my spine.",my head is still spinning ,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics 'my head is still spinning' vaguely capture the sense of unease or anxiety, which aligns slightly with the user's emotional state of being worried about a friend driving through a storm. However, the lyrics do not specifically address the context of the thunderstorm, the friend's safety, or the user's fear, resulting in a very low contextual relevance score. The lyrical coherence is also low as the provided lyrics are too brief and fragmented to form a coherent narrative or emotional expression."
"I came home after a long day to find my partner had cleaned up and cooked dinner, and it made me realize how lucky I am to have them.",last night we brought the children by to visit their grandpa and it s plain to see they re truly part of him while we were there their grandma took out some old photographs man he sure looked a lot like me back then i m seein my father in me i guess that s how it s meant to be and i find i m more and more like him each day i notice i walk the way he walks i notice i talk the way he talks i m startin to see my father in me and today i took my wife for a walk down that old dirt road where my daddy took my mom so many times and we found the time to mention things we never had before and we shared some thoughts about the family life yeah i m seein my father in me i guess that s how it s meant to be and i find i m more and more like him each day i notice i walk the way he walks i notice i talk the way he talks i m startin to see my father in me and now lookin back i can recall the times we disagreed when i could not take hold of his old fashioned ways and the more i tried to prove him wrong the more i proved him right now i know why he still stood by me when i went through that stage i m seein my father in me i guess that s how it s meant to be and i find i m more and more like him each day i notice i walk the way he walks i notice i talk the way he talks i m startin to see my father in me and i m happy to see my father in me,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,"The recommended song primarily focuses on a person reflecting on how they resemble their father in various ways, both physically and behaviorally, and appreciating family life. Emotional alignment scores low as the song's theme of familial resemblance and legacy does not directly reflect the user's feelings of gratitude and realization of luck regarding their partner's actions. Contextually, the song also scores low because it does not match the specific scenario of coming home to a partner's thoughtful gestures. However, the song scores higher in lyrical coherence as the lyrics are fluent and tell a clear, coherent story about family resemblance and relationships."
"I just found my grandmother’s favorite shawl tucked in her chair, and tears welled up as I remembered her warmth.",there s a blanket of snow covering up the old road to the house where i was raised through the window i see the lights on the tree and a glow from the old fireplace though it all looks the same so much as changed from the way it used to be christmas memories of happy years gone by they come back to me and keep me warm inside still those memories make me cry now the stockings are filled the old house is still and the kids are all dreaming away there s that old easy chair me and daddy sat there waiting for santa s sleigh now daddy has gone but we ll carry on cause the little ones still need christmas memories of happy years gone by they come back to me and keep me warm inside still those christmas memories oh they mean so much to me oh those christmas memories make me cry,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of nostalgia and emotional warmth, aligning well with the user's feelings of remembering a loved one, hence scoring high on emotional alignment. The context of the song, centered around Christmas and familial memories, partially matches the user's scenario of reminiscence but is not a perfect fit since the user's prompt does not specify a holiday context, leading to a moderate score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are fluent and evoke a clear narrative, making them quite coherent. Overall, the song captures the essence of remembering cherished moments with loved ones, though it is set in a specific seasonal context that might not perfectly align with the user's current experience."
"I opened my inbox this morning to find I’d received my scholarship award, and I can’t stop grinning from ear to ear.",i think i saw ol santa through my window christmas eve my eyes were really droopy but i really do believe it must ve been ol santa cause i saw his big red hat and i know my mom and dad can t fly like that oh no and then i heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door the same ol christmas trick my dad had played since i was four he stands outside my bedroom yelling ho ho ho because he knows i don t believe in santa claus no way i think my daddy sees me peeking from my door but he pretends he s santa anyway every year he tries to fool me but i m a big boy now i don t believe in santa or his sleigh no way so i went back to my bed and i curled up nice and tight i stared out of my window and i looked into the night and then all of a sudden through my window i could see santa claus was flying by and smiling at me santa claus santa claus it must ve been ol santa claus santa claus santa claus happy ho ho ho to you and then i heard ol rudolph tellin me to come outside he told me that ol santa wanted me to take a ride i climbed out of my window and i jumped onto his sleigh and then ol santa took me up and away  we flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below i saw my big red school house and the town square picture show it was really past my bedtime and so ol santa said little boys like you should be in bed so i hollered ho ho ho and i put on santa s hat then he let me hold the reins a while we pulled up to my window and i jumped back in my room and i waved goodbye to santa with a smile when i woke up christmas morning well it was clear and bright my parents said my window had blown open in the night i smiled as i told them that it must ve been the cat and they asked me where i got my big red hat yeah yeah c mon santa claus santa claus it must ve been ol santa claus santa claus santa claus happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you happy ho ho ho to you one more again,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song is a Christmas-themed narrative about a child's playful interaction with a figure believed to be Santa Claus, which does not align with the user's prompt about receiving a scholarship award. The emotional alignment is very poor as the song's joyful, whimsical tone about a childhood Christmas experience does not reflect the specific joy and accomplishment related to receiving a scholarship. Contextually, the song is also irrelevant as it discusses Christmas and Santa Claus, which have no connection to academic achievements or scholarships. The lyrical coherence is moderate as the story within the song is consistent and follows a clear narrative, but it does not help in aligning with the user's emotional or contextual needs."
"I woke up this morning to find a bouquet of flowers on my nightstand with a note that said ‘just because’, and my heart melted.",at this point in my life clearly i can see all the gifts he bestowed upon me that is why deep inside i have this joy there was once a time my soul was searching to find a place to nest now in this joy i can rest now my heart holds the love he has given me and that s all that i ll ever need to live believe and spread his love i m so glad i have this joy,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a deep sense of joy and gratitude, which aligns well with the user's emotional state of feeling touched and loved, as indicated by the surprise bouquet. However, the song's context focuses more on spiritual or divine love and gratitude, rather than the romantic or affectionate gesture described in the user's prompt, leading to a lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, but the flow and structure might be slightly confusing without the music, affecting the lyrical coherence score."
"I just sat down to record my podcast and realized I hadn’t rehearsed my opening lines, and I felt my palms grow clammy.",and i have grown i have could ve sworn i have for long i was certain that i saw it clear i am you then your sweaty palms surround it and i have grown i have could ve sworn i had but i forgot that i ever really was here heaving with all my might hear the lightning through the sky heaving with all my might hear the lightning through this for long i was certain that i saw it clear i am you than your sweaty palms surrounded but i forgot that i was ever really was here ,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,"The song's mention of 'sweaty palms' does align somewhat with the user's emotional state of nervousness and anxiety. However, the overall context of the song does not seem to directly relate to the specific scenario of recording a podcast or the preparation involved. The lyrics are quite disjointed and lack fluency, making it difficult to discern a clear narrative or theme, which significantly affects the coherence score. Overall, while there is a slight emotional connection, the song does not effectively match the user's situation in terms of context and lyrical clarity."
I just watched the sunrise break through the clouds and felt sure today would bring new opportunities.,as i aimlessly wander around how could i ever expect to be found until looking down and seeing the light at the ground by my feet i heard angels resound and there i avowed this is the road i would take just to make it there for my sake now i say that i ll never break chorus i can get there by the light at my feet you ve made me walk in electricity i can get there by the light at my feet you are my everything all that i need now that i see it s so easy for me to proceed on to my destiny and let it be seen the light that you ve given thee let it be efficiently electricity you can take me there,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of hope and determination, aligning well with the user's emotional state of feeling optimistic about new opportunities after witnessing a sunrise. The mention of 'light at my feet' and 'angels resound' metaphorically captures the uplifting and inspiring moment similar to a sunrise, making it contextually relevant. However, the lyrical coherence is slightly lower as the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and the flow is disrupted by abrupt transitions, though the overall message remains clear."
I just saw my project showcased in the company newsletter and couldn’t help but beam at what I’d accomplished.,i woke about nine opened up my eyes figured it s time to rise threw the curtains open wide and peeped outside yo the weather was fine i knew that was a sign that today would be a good day i popped a cd on jumped in the shower sploshed and washed till i m fresh like a flower next grab a towel and i dry myself off i grab my vest cos next it s time to get dressed i rocked white socks my fubu boxers clean white jeans and this mean white top wot zips down the side of my neck to my left shoulder blade feel like i just got paid today yeah brushed my teeth and my hair then i popped my contacts in and binned the containers put on my trainers out the front door waves hi to the neighbours oh what a glorious thing waking up in the morning baby oh what a glorious thing get to have a whole day hey so i hop on my stolen bike and ride down the kingsland road bouncing over speed bumps calves pump pedals the way i ramp that plank i desrve a frigging medal petrol fumes looms as my bike zooms stuck behind a bus wot s rough so i cough which reminds me when the sun s blistering i m gonna have to take an anti histamine or else i ll get stressed again sneeze so hard i split my vest again vex my chest till i m depressed again no way pos sis so i drop by the office check out my emails females blowing up my inbox boom soon though i m off again headed down park hook up with my peeps we kick ball till its dark then we re off to rock a show and i m super glad it s stunners time kicking dope rhymes in the summertime word,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song captures a positive and upbeat emotion, aligning well with the user's feeling of pride and accomplishment (Emotional alignment: 4). However, the context of the song, which describes a day filled with various casual activities and personal leisure, only partially matches the user's professional achievement context (Contextual relevance: 2). The lyrics are somewhat coherent with a clear narrative of enjoying a good day, though some parts may seem disjointed or overly casual compared to the user's scenario (Lyrical coherence: 3). Overall, while the song carries the right energy, its thematic focus and style are not a perfect fit for celebrating a professional milestone."
"I just found an old photo of my childhood home tucked away in a drawer, and it made me realize how far I’ve come.",there s an old kodak camera in my dresser drawer i ran across it just this afternoon and i realized that i don t ever use it anymore in fact last time i did i think it was with you when we were down in cozumel we had the whole beach to ourselves and it s crazy now to think that it s all there on that film and i could take it to the store to be developed but what for i can still see everything just fine and who needs pictures with a memory like mine standing there i couldn t help but think about everything that might be on that roll i think it even has another trip we took i guess that must ve been at least three years ago when we were down in baton rouge and there wasn t much to do so we drove into new orleans every afternoon and i swear that you would think that it was only yesterday cause i can still see everything just fine who needs pictures with a memory like mine somewhere in my closet there s a cardboard box just sitting on a shelf it s full of faded memories and it s been there ever since the night you left oh just forgotten photographs to remind me of the past oh but i can still see everything just fine who needs pictures with a memory like mine yeah who needs pictures with a memory like mine,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,"The song's lyrics about finding an old camera and reminiscing about past experiences align well with the user's emotional state triggered by finding an old photo of their childhood home. The emotional alignment is strong as both the song and the prompt evoke nostalgia and reflection on personal growth and change. The contextual relevance is excellent, as the song directly discusses the act of finding old memories and the impact of those memories, which closely mirrors the user's experience with the photo. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear, consistent story about memories and the passage of time, though some repetitive elements slightly affect the fluency. Overall, the song is a good match for the user's emotional and contextual needs, effectively capturing the nostalgic and reflective mood prompted by rediscovering a piece of one's past."
"I just got the call that my test results came back clear, and I felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders.",let me down now i m falling off the line and i can feel it crawling through my spine because in my room now i feel so divine not a worry running through my mind,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song lyrics chosen reflect a sense of relief and freedom from worry, which aligns well with the user's emotional state of feeling a 'huge weight lift off their shoulders' after receiving good news about their test results. This results in a high score for emotional alignment. The context of the song, which seems to describe a personal moment of liberation and tranquility, is somewhat relevant to the user's situation of receiving positive health news, though it's not a perfect match, hence the moderate score for contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, conveying a clear feeling of ease and peace, but they could be more structured and detailed to enhance understanding, leading to an average score for lyrical coherence."

However, the context of the song, which includes references to violence, substance abuse, and casual relationships, diverges significantly from the user's context of a single regrettable message to a friend, leading to a lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat coherent with a clear theme of apology, though the frequent shifts in subject matter and tone affect the overall fluency, resulting in a moderate score for lyrical coherence."
"I just sat down for dinner and saw my father’s chair still empty, my heart ached and I can’t stop crying.",on the day you died i cut my hair for the funeral and on memorial day i started drinking because it got kind of hard just sitting there thinking about mom all alone in that house and i m too far away to do our lunch dates she misses the regimen she misses the annoyances the free time is bittersweet,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The recommended song lyrics strongly align with the emotional aspect of the user's prompt, reflecting the pain and grief of losing a loved one, which is evident in the user's emotional state from the empty chair of a father. The lyrics discuss the aftermath of a death, including personal changes and the impact on family members left behind, which resonates with the user's situation. Contextually, the song fits as it deals with loss and remembrance, though it shifts focus slightly by discussing the singer's mother and personal coping mechanisms rather than directly addressing the father's absence as in the user's prompt. The lyrics are coherent, presenting a clear narrative of coping with loss, though some lines might feel slightly disjointed without the context of the full song. Overall, the song captures the essence of grief and remembrance, making it a suitable choice for the user's emotional state, though it could align more closely with the specific context of the father's absence."
"I just discovered a heartfelt letter from my childhood friend tucked inside an old book, and I was completely caught off guard.",i got a surprise from my honey i got a message from my girl when she picked up a pen from the side of the bed and wrote me a scribbled note that she was coming back to see me she was visiting real soon gonna get up from the long white bed and leave this cold white room wah ooo wah ooo wah ooo we would once more live together go out on a loving spree just like before the accident my baby would look at me i saw her sweet face trembling as she tried to open her eyes i jumped with the joy of a grateful boy the day my baby gave me a surprise wah ooo wah ooo wah ooo i got a surprise from my honey i got a message from my girl when she picked up a pen from the side of the bed and wrote me a scribbled note i saw her sweet face trembling as she tried to open her eyes i jumped with the joy of a grateful boy the day my baby gave me a surprise wah ooo wah ooo wah ooo,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.67,"The song captures a sense of surprise and emotional impact similar to the user's experience of finding a letter, which aligns moderately well with the emotional aspect of the prompt. However, the context of the song, which revolves around a romantic relationship and a significant other recovering from an accident, diverges significantly from the nostalgic and platonic nature of finding a childhood friend's letter. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and simplistic but maintain a coherent narrative about receiving an unexpected message, which moderately matches the lyrical coherence criterion. Overall, while there are elements of surprise and emotional resonance, the song's specific scenario and thematic focus do not align closely with the user's described situation."
I really look up to my brother. I hope I can be like him one day.,i ve waited for this day for such a long time you are everything i ve waited for if memory says i might be disappointed cause a lifetime here with you will seem to short all i see is white that s coming towards me all i ve wanted you within my arms if it s required that i forsake all others i ll do that and more i ve waited for this day for such a long time i hope that i can be what you deserve i hope the days get longer and make this love grow stronger god will be the strength and our reason,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song lyrics express a sense of anticipation and commitment, which aligns somewhat with the user's admiration and aspiration to be like their brother, scoring a 2 in emotional alignment. However, the song seems to be more focused on a romantic or deeply personal relationship rather than the fraternal, aspirational context indicated by the user, resulting in a low contextual relevance score of 1. The lyrics themselves are moderately coherent, maintaining a consistent theme of dedication and longing, thus scoring a 3 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional and contextual needs, leading to an overall score of 2."
I watched this concert today and couldn’t stop laughing and smiling. It just made me feel so light and entertained.,let s sit here in the breakdown lane let s ohh and ahh until the show stops the way it makes your face light up let s have a show of hands who s enjoying themselves i know i am,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The recommended song captures the emotion of joy and entertainment as reflected in the user's experience of feeling 'light and entertained' at a concert. The lyrics suggest a shared, enjoyable experience ('who's enjoying themselves, I know I am'), which aligns well with the user's emotional state. However, the context of sitting in a 'breakdown lane' might not perfectly align with the user's context of watching a concert, thus the slightly lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is somewhat fragmented and lacks fluency, making it harder to follow, which impacts the coherence score."

The context of being hurt by someone trusted is directly addressed in the song, making it highly relevant. The lyrics are mostly coherent and fluently express the emotions of hurt and betrayal, though some repetitive lines might slightly detract from the overall coherence. Overall, the song is an excellent match for the user's emotional and contextual needs."

This scores high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on interpersonal conflict and emotional turmoil, which is somewhat relevant to the user's situation of dealing with an irritating individual, though it delves more into a broader spectrum of relationship issues rather than the specific trigger of speech. The lyrical coherence is somewhat lower as the lyrics are quite disjointed and chaotic, reflecting the inner turmoil but making it harder to follow a clear narrative or message."
Someone at work has been handling things incredibly well. I just wanted to say I genuinely respect how he manages everything.,he is a mighty good god for him there s nothing to hard there is no problem he can t solve he is the lord of all in him i find no fault in him there is no failure in him i will not lack he is the lord of all in you i find no fault in you there is no failure in you i will not lack you are the lord of all you are the lord of all yes you are yes you are you are the lord of all ,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics focus on praising and acknowledging the omnipotence and perfection of a divine figure, which only partially aligns with the user's intent to express respect for a colleague's management skills. The emotional alignment is low because the song conveys a sense of worship and reverence that is more spiritual than the professional admiration intended in the prompt. Contextually, the song is also not very relevant as it addresses divine attributes rather than human leadership or management qualities. The lyrics themselves, while somewhat repetitive, maintain a basic level of coherence with clear references to the attributes of the figure being praised. However, the overall match to the user's prompt is low, as the song does not effectively reflect the specific professional context or the type of respect the user wishes to express."
"I’ve been taking care of a little bunny for a couple of years, and I feel so responsible for his well-being. He means a lot to me.",you know that i care what happens to you and i know that you care for me so i don t feel alone or the weight of the stone now that i ve found somewhere safe to bury my bone and any fool knows a dog needs a home a shelter from pigs on the wing,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of care and responsibility, aligning well with the user's emotional state regarding their attachment and duty towards their pet bunny. This scores high in emotional alignment. However, the contextual relevance is moderate as the lyrics specifically mention a dog, which might not perfectly resonate with the user's experience with a bunny, though the general theme of caring for a pet remains relevant. The lyrical coherence is average; the lyrics are somewhat poetic and metaphorical, which might require some interpretation but generally maintain a coherent flow about caring for a dependent creature and finding a safe space for them."

The context of the song, which seems to deal with reflections on past relationships and life decisions, partially matches the user's situation of being in a new and confusing environment, scoring a 3 for contextual relevance. However, the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative flow, making it difficult to fully grasp the message, resulting in a coherence score of 2. Overall, the song moderately addresses the user's feelings and context but could be clearer in its lyrical presentation."

The emotional alignment score is high because the lyrics express a similar excitement and desire for change. Contextually, the song touches on themes of personal transformation and introspection, which is somewhat relevant to the user's interest in diving into new ideas, though it focuses more on internal change rather than external exploration of topics. The lyrical coherence is moderate; while the lyrics are somewhat poetic and expressive, they can be seen as slightly disjointed and cryptic, which might make it harder for some listeners to fully grasp or relate to the message."
"More than anything right now, I just want to grow and improve. I want to become someone I can be proud of.",we can pretend who we can be a dancer in a top hat or a captain of the sea i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see i just want to be to look and sound just like me i just want to be myself for everyone to see,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics align well with the user's emotional state of wanting to grow and improve, particularly in terms of self-acceptance and authenticity. The repeated lines 'I just want to be myself for everyone to see' resonate with the desire to be genuine and true to oneself, which is a crucial aspect of personal growth. Contextually, the song fits the theme of self-improvement and identity exploration. However, the lyrical coherence is slightly lower due to the somewhat repetitive nature and the simplistic expression, which might not fully capture the depth of the user's emotional journey towards self-improvement."

It hurts more than I expected.",i ve been so long without you i try not to think about you but i do i know that i m to blame i got no right to call your name but i do i do i m so hurt to think that you d lie to me i m hurt way down deep inside of me,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song's lyrics reflect a strong sense of betrayal and emotional pain, aligning well with the user's feelings of being let down by someone close. The emotional alignment is high as the lyrics express hurt and disappointment, resonating with the user's experience. Contextually, the song fits the theme of betrayal and emotional distress, though it leans more towards a romantic context rather than a general personal betrayal, which slightly limits its contextual relevance. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express the feelings of hurt and betrayal, making them easy to understand and relate to. Overall, the song is a good match for the user's emotional state and context, though the specific nature of the relationship in the song lyrics might not perfectly align with the user's situation."

Contextually, the song touches on the theme of finding comfort in someone who listens and understands, which is relevant but not directly addressing the situation of being laughed at by others.

However, the song's focus on international travel and eating a wide array of foods from different countries does not directly relate to the specific context of cooking with an air fryer, resulting in a low contextual relevance score. The lyrics themselves are repetitive and somewhat nonsensical, especially with lines like 'eat a bowl of ebola,' which detracts from the coherence of the song, leading to a low score in lyrical coherence."
"I had a terrifying moment recently—my whole body froze, and I felt like something horrible was about to happen.",awakened by the fear of an omnipresent danger and the absence of touch accordingly my heart beats alone sucked dry of all emotion it bleeds for feeling but i m so scared i ll run into another wall afraid to lose my mortality i stand alone shivering cold alone naked for the world to see breathing becomes easy as i come closer to confronting my fear now i lay in that same dead end state as i was before frozen from your icy touch cold as i was before alone for the world to see,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"The song lyrics strongly align with the user's emotional state of fear and the sensation of being frozen, scoring high in emotional alignment. The context of feeling exposed and vulnerable, as described in the lyrics, resonates well with the user's description of a terrifying moment, though it slightly diverges towards a more general existential fear rather than a specific incident, hence the slightly lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is moderate; while the lyrics are evocative and thematic, they can be somewhat disjointed and abstract, which might make it harder for some listeners to fully grasp or relate to the narrative."

The context of expressing thanks and acknowledging blessings fits reasonably with the user's reflective mood, earning a 3 in contextual relevance. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low, scoring a 2, as the lyrics seem somewhat disjointed and lack a smooth flow, which might detract from the overall impact of the message. The overall score is 3, indicating that while the song captures the essence of gratitude, its effectiveness is reduced by the lack of lyrical fluency."
"Someone very important to me is gone, and no matter how much time passes, I still feel the weight of that loss.",i ve been so long without you i try not to think about you but i do i know that i m to blame i got no right to call your name but i do i do i m so hurt to think that you d lie to me i m hurt way down deep inside of me,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of loss and longing, aligning well with the emotional prompt of missing someone important. The lyrics express a deep hurt and the difficulty of moving on, which resonates with the user's feelings of enduring the weight of loss. However, the song also introduces elements of betrayal ('think that you'd lie to me'), which might not completely align with the user's context if their loss was not under similar circumstances. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express the pain of missing someone, though the focus on betrayal might slightly detract from the overall relevance to the user's specific emotional context."

This earns a high score in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song discusses the joy and fulfillment found in a loving relationship, which is relevant but not perfectly aligned with the user's situation of unconfirmed or unexpressed feelings, hence a moderate score. The lyrical coherence is somewhat low due to repetitive phrases and a lack of clear narrative progression, making it harder to follow the story or message beyond the repeated expression of being in love."
I stood in front of a huge and wasn't able to blurt out a single sentence. My knees were shaking the whole time.,i spent my night sweating through my clothes and screaming til my throat ached like burning coals still its not right now that everything i know gets caught between the gnashing teeth of the hype machine and so it goes ive never felt more alone,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song captures the intense emotional distress described in the user's prompt, particularly the feelings of anxiety and being overwhelmed, as reflected in the lyrics about sweating, screaming, and feeling alone. However, the context of the song, which seems to address issues related to public exposure or media scrutiny ('gnashing teeth of the hype machine'), does not perfectly align with the user's situation of being unable to speak in front of a crowd. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, but the metaphorical language and lack of clear narrative might make it difficult for some listeners to fully grasp or relate to the message."

The lyrics directly reflect the emotion of looking forward to a bright future, scoring a 5 in emotional alignment. The context of the song, which speaks about the promise of a better tomorrow, perfectly matches the user's sentiment about the upcoming day being the best ever, thus scoring a 5 in contextual relevance. The lyrical coherence is generally good, with a clear and repetitive message that reinforces the theme of hope and dreams; however, the repetitive nature might slightly hinder the depth, resulting in a score of 4. Overall, the song is an excellent match for the user's emotional and contextual needs, providing a hopeful and uplifting message."

The lyrics' themes of conflict, choice, and standing up resonate with the user's context of needing to show their worth and ideals despite opposition (Contextual relevance: 3). However, the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and cryptic, making it difficult to fully grasp a coherent narrative or message, which affects the overall clarity and impact of the song (Lyrical coherence: 2). Overall, the song matches the user's emotional and contextual needs to a good extent but is hindered by its lyrical complexity."
"After going over the situation again, something finally clicked for me. I understand now what I didn’t see before.",i realised you saw right through this and you rise always i realised you re i realised you saw right through this and you rise always what made you right and didn t i free and didn t i solve and didn t i see what made you right and didn t i free and didn t i solve and didn t i see what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right what made you right ,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"The song lyrics seem to touch on themes of realization and understanding, which aligns somewhat with the user's emotional state of finally having an epiphany. This scores a 3 in emotional alignment. However, the context of the song is vague and repetitive, making it difficult to fully grasp how it relates to the specific nature of the user's newfound understanding, thus scoring a 2 in contextual relevance. The lyrics themselves are highly repetitive and lack clear structure or progression, which impacts their fluency and overall coherence, leading to a score of 1 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song partially matches the user's emotional state but struggles with clarity and relevance."
After today’s show I was finally able to relax for a while,i can t seem to kill my assailants they just keep changing faces i must be sleeping it all off just like you had promised so glad you could make it to a farewell until we meet again enjoy yourself just sit back and relax and start the show,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's emotional tone partially aligns with the user's feeling of relaxation after a show, particularly in the phrases 'enjoy yourself' and 'just sit back and relax.' However, the mention of 'assailants' and 'sleeping it off' introduces a sense of conflict or recovery that doesn't quite match the simple relaxation described in the prompt. Contextually, the song seems to address themes of parting and possibly darker undertones, which doesn't fit well with the user's scenario of unwinding post-show. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, but the abrupt shifts in theme from confrontation to relaxation can be confusing, impacting the overall coherence."
"The more I think about it, the more I realize I made a terrible mistake. I really regret what I did.",i regret leaving my soul i forgot i needed it to feel and maybe when i die i ll just grab it real quick i m coming right back i regret leaving my mind i forgot i needed it to think and maybe to keep me alive i can t believe i got so far with a head so empty but i still have eyes wait for me wait for me but i still have feet wait for me wait for me i regret leaving at all i forgot i needed god like big brother and maybe when i die yeah when i die i won t die escaping i ll die returning to the fold but i still have eyes wait for me wait for me but i still have feet wait for me wait for me but i still have faith if i ever had faith wait for me wait for me,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"The song's lyrics strongly align with the user's emotional state of regret and reflection on past mistakes, which is evident in the repeated expressions of regret and the metaphorical references to having left essential parts of oneself behind (soul, mind). This matches the emotional prompt perfectly, scoring a 5 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song fits well as it discusses the consequences of one's actions and a desire to rectify or come to terms with them, scoring a 4. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat lower, scoring a 3, due to the abstract and somewhat disjointed nature of the lyrics, which might make it harder for some listeners to follow or fully grasp the intended message."
I haven’t been able to stop crying. I just feel this overwhelming sadness I don’t know how to handle.,i m sorry your situation has let you down i know that things did not go as planned because in this time you re feeling alone and sad this is what you must understand there is a way yesterday is gone it s a new day yesterday is gone my dear kay you can t get nowhere staying at home and crying you can t go on living in the past the one thing constant is that there is always change ,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,"The song lyrics attempt to address the user's overwhelming sadness by acknowledging the situation and suggesting a perspective of change and moving forward. However, the emotional alignment scores lower because the lyrics might seem to underplay the depth of the user's current emotional state by quickly shifting to advice on moving past the sadness, which might not fully resonate with someone deeply entrenched in their feelings. Contextually, the song fits as it addresses feelings of sadness and the need for change, which is relevant to the user's situation. The lyrics are coherent and follow a logical progression in advising the listener to look beyond their current circumstances, though they could potentially feel dismissive depending on the user's sensitivity to their emotional state."
My family just told me something completely unexpected... I’m still trying to wrap my head around it.,well i was ready to walk into your heart i ll make believe there s something i ve lost but i think you know what i ve done oh i think you know i ll be your surprise it s just a secret that s alwasy on display or just a memory you can t throw away oh i ll be your surprise,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.67,"The song's lyrics seem to touch on themes of secrets and surprises, which could loosely connect to the user's experience of receiving unexpected news. However, the emotional alignment is weak as the song's tone and content do not deeply resonate with the confusion and need for understanding expressed in the user's prompt. Contextually, the song's mention of surprises only superficially relates to the unexpected nature of the news, lacking depth in addressing the user's emotional processing of the information. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making it difficult to derive a clear and fluent narrative or emotional thread."
