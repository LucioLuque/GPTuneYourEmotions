Watching my teammate stay late to coach the interns after hours left me genuinely inspired.,as i pondered the thought of evolving as an artist i was inside of my office meditating in the darkness an uncomfortable pounding was hitting in my chest when the patient walked in i was sitting at my desk as my thought reached his height the room became bright then i stood up and slapped him for turning on the light then i told him to be seated as he started to explain how the negative influences had targeted his brain the ratchetness defeated my ability to fight it i know that it s atrocious but somehow i ve grown to like it in one minute i deciphered the symptoms shut up and listen you ve been poisoned and conditioned through audio repetition and media false religions and visual exhibitions the medicine to the sickness requires no prescription i opened up a cabinet a container was revealed then i told him to be still lay back and take this pill what are you tryna do i m going to deprogram you what are you going to do i m going to deprogram you no just let me go i can t stand you doctor damn you you ll thank me when i m through just let me deprogram you it was obvious his mind was rejecting cause he was choking three seconds after he took it his body started convulsing i ve been doing this for years i m trained i m not a novice so i recognized quickly an exorcism was in progress the process wasn t clean he was harder to redeem this was one of the most extreme cases i d ever seen i expected little resistance but never a rejecter hooked his brain up to this thing that showed his thoughts on a projector screen every idea and dream he ever dreamed told my secretary jean to bring me a nectarine as i ate it i sat back and let the method take it s course it rewound back eventually landing at the source when the needle spiked hard i got anxious i saw how the dangerous language came through his subconscious chambers initiating gradual changes that were rendering him brainless the power blew and shorted out the main switch what are you tryna do i m going to deprogram you what are you going to do i m going to deprogram you no just let me go i can t stand you doctor damn you you ll thank me when i m through just let me deprogram you  my maintenance coordinator powered the generator then i placed him into great situational simulator filled his conscience with both beneficial and nonsense featured good and evil and monitored his responses with weaker content his vessel paraded about anything positive he regurgitated it out i leaned over the table to scream don t let it break you this fake music was specially designed to overtake you the superficial nature of this garbage i revealed it s an audio mirage this stuff is not even real it s only a spell they sent to keep your true potential in the basement demented strategic radio placement i thought it would get better but then i saw no chances he started yelling turn up and doing funny dances he seemed to be getting worse than he was when he came in i hollered for my intern to come help me restrain him he would die if i couldn t stop the ignorance from reigning the clock was ticking down only two minutes remaining to save him i was racing but he gave no indication my track record s impeccable i ve never lost a patient so failure i never knew each second the pressure grew came to the conclusion there was only one thing left to do he s nearly a vegetable i have to handle this directly laid on the table next to him told my intern to connect me and effectively inject more intellect till he was stable similar to car batteries connected with jumper cables but if it didn t work i would lose all my brain fluid my intern said please don t i said shut up and do it when he plugged me to try it sparks flew from the wires the lights were flicking on and off the room was on fire and purple communication after that was non verbal the screen said total completion of transferral the course had ran thorough but something was still concerning in silence both of us were laid motionless on the gurney the patient s eyes opened as the sun beamed through the window my team started removing the chords from our temples he raised up and said he was healed the method s proven they waited for me to respond still i wasn t moving they entertained the thought that i had let my tactics break me they did everything in their power to resuscitate me one of them read the bible as i laid there idle and multiple devices were used to check the vitals they shocked me medicated me but still wasn t recovering they worked to bring me back a whole hour but still nothing then grateful for my sacrifice and all of my devotion they drove me 700 miles and placed me in the ocean i floated out to sea as they cried and started grieving they stayed the entire evening said some words before leaving they travelled home mourning the demise of the doctor returned to the facility to empty out their lockers they came back to the building walked inside and nearly lost it looked down the hall and saw me watching tv in my office drinking a cup of coffee relaxed trying to chill as the patient tried to hug me i just handed him the bill everyone was like we thought you had suffered sure disaster i said yes i know that s why you re the students and i m the master now get back to work 4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The

The courier dumped my brand-new keyboard in a puddle and walked off—I'm fuming.,so what if i just couldn t take it anymore i ll just take a walk to the store looking for a bit of bottled rat poison to score and i ll pour down my gullet to nullify the sullenness if it s my destiny to kill me spill it in me to begin to fulfill it give it a couple of minutes until it hits but still it doesn t seem to be taking effect i m still walking erect what the heck what the hell well at least i paid the guy with a cheque so if the bodega janked me on the poison i drank all i gotta do is place a cancel call to my bank but they put me on hold when i told them the story first i cursed in the phone but the music ignored me and it played and it played for such a long time and then a voice said we ll be with you soon just stay on the line but just at that second my neck broke out in a sweat i said i bet this is it the poison s starting to hit i felt sick and in pain i dropped the phone to the ground and an operator came and said can i help you now but all that she could hear was just the sound of my death as i gasped into the set just let the guy cash the cheque with my last rattling breath and the burning bottle of crap that i sickly held in my lap i quickly turned on the cap out of concern for the rats so what if i just couldn t take it anymore so what if i just couldn t take it anymore i ll just take the decision to walk on the bridge and try to fly like a pigeon and i tramp up the ramp and all the bicycles pass and i just can t help but laugh when i think back on my past and all of the retarded mistakes that i made the broken hearted dismay that started from the first grade all the way up to today and the walkway is steep and the cars are all beeping and the people are sailing to wherever they re sailing and i m climbing the railings i plan to stand and decide but i just slip and i dive and all the drunks on the side start to hold up their signs mostly 7s and 9s but now and then is a 10 and if i fell to earth i d be dead that s for sure but like i said before it s only water and it s worthless cos it isn t on purpose but i bob to the surface but a large garbage barge comes and it drops 20 tonnes of toxic waste on my face and as i sink from the sun to whatever s to come my last sight is the bums who all change their signs into 3s 2s and 1s and then after this discourse there s a 3 6 of course it must be from pitchfork so what if i just couldn t take it anymore so what if i just couldn t take it anymore staring down at the floor staring up at the ceiling cos i never get used to always feeling so unglued need new emails to read through while i eat old chinese food i don t want a life that s like this just take a knife to my wrist quick all i ve got is this chopstick but i could still make the plot thick just for the sake of context if i break it with my fist for fun against my chest run into the wall next and i ll frown at the gash then lie down in the bath with some sylvia plath how many pages will pass until i m facing my last i didn t major in math so i won t wager no cash but truth is stranger than fashion and the danger is that all of the blood will amass and the tub will fill up so fast til i m encased like a crab in a bathtub shaped scab they ll have to take in a cab and scrape off in a lab so what if i just couldn t take it anymore so what if i just couldn t take it anymore i ll just call up the mob and say i ve got you a job i guess you know what to do knock off this guy with the blues an offer you can t refuse and i ll fax them a contract through a third party contact that says don t hold him for ransom i ll pay half in advance just mail me one of his hands which i ll accept as your answer so say it so happens i happen to be out lying on a park bench and crying just like my normal way but in most former cases no one comes out of no place wraps masking tape on my face but that s what happens today but before i get knocked off my hand it gets chopped off and dropped in a mailbox and i m locked in a trunk but i m flung out on the tar when the car hits a bump at exit one twenty five out on the fdr drive i get a minute of rest and isn t this interesting here comes the ups man the package ain t hard to guess but i gotta sign with my left hand so what if i just couldn t take it anymore ,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.

and on genius alfred lin i ll set the stage with some slides and a few comments but the main stage is going to be with brian when he comes up and talks about how he built the airbnb culture so you are here you have been following the presentations so you know how to get started you have built a team you know how to build your product its off the ground it s growing people love it you figured out how to do that you figured out to create a special one of a kind company with monopoly powers thats big and the market you are chasing after is slightly bigger than the paper airplane business so you are good right so now what so we are here to submit that actually culture is the thing that is actually going to be very very important to scale the business as well as your team and hopefully after this talk you will be able to know what is culture why does it matter how do you create your core values and think about elements that fit together for core values and culture that create a high performance team get some best practices for the culture what is culture anybody want to take a guess at how one should define this yeah thats good did you look that up because you had a computer and an internet connection these are some definitions that you will find in websters dictionary but we are stanford this is kind of a trick question its a cs class the questions are never straight forward the real question is what is the company culture going to be culture we can generally talk about society about groups about places or things here we re talking about company culture so how does one define company culture we can take the previous definition and modify it a little bit this is a hint of how we may want to define company culture every day blank and blank of each member of the team in pursuit of our company blank some people have filled these in with different things the first blank a could be assumptions beliefs values now my favorite is core values the second blank for the b blank people said behavior my favorite is action how do you act in pursuit of goals thats kind of weak in pursuit of big and hairy audacious goals is a little stronger but a better definition is in the pursuit of mission so now that we have that definition what do we do with that and why does it matter this is a quote from gandhi your beliefs become your thoughts your thoughts become your words your words become your actions your actions become the habits your habits become your values and your values become your destiny if you don t have a good culture in the company you cant pursue your destiny why it matters is that it becomes the first principles you sort of go back to when you make decisions it becomes a way to align people on values that matter to the company it provides a certain level of stability to fall back on and it provides level of trust people sort of trust each other with but it also gives us a list with which you should be able to figure out what to do and what not to do and what the more important thing about that is what not to do then finally the other thing that is important is it allows you to retain the right employees there are people in this world that are not going to be a fit for your company but if you have good strong culture and the strong core values you ll know who you want to retain and who you truly do not want to retain and if you take the first letter of those it happens to help you move faster another reason you re thinking that s like all mushy stuff this is actually more scientific stuff so here are indices from 1994 to 2013 stock market indices of companies in the s p500 and the russell 3000 and the fortune 100 best companies to work for all these companies out there and they picked out companies that they believed were the best companies to work for the stock market returns of those companies happen to be 11 8 which is almost twice that of the other two indices and so there is real power in companies that treat their employees well where there s a lot of trust there is a lot of strong culture so how do you create a set of values and define the culture etc get asked that a lot you have to start with the leader of the company and the founder and ask yourself what are the values that are the most important to you of those things that are most important in the business who are the types of people you like working with and what are their values and through that you distill together what a set of values are think about all the people that you ve never liked working with what values do they have think of the opposite of that maybe those should be considered values for your company finally remember the values have to support your mission and if they don t support your mission youre missing something then the last final checks are they have to be creditable they have to be uniquely tied to match your mission so at zappos in terms of uniquely applied to the mission we were focused on creating a culture that was going to provide great customer service so the first core value we had was to deliver wow through service we are very specific that we wanted to deliver great customer service and it was going to be a wow experience and then below that we wanted to serve i had a paragraph talking about what we mean by that we wanted to support them doing the wow through service and support people such as our employees our customers our brand partners and investors on terms of the opposite thing we generally didnt like working with arrogant people so one of our core values at zappos was to be humble so those are two examples where we create core values in a way that became credible and uniquely tied to our mission so you go through this process you come up with a few core values these might be some of them whether it s honesty integrity service teamwork it might be a list you might start with three might end up with a list of ten you might have a list of thirty its a good start when zappos went through this process we asked all the employees at the time what core values they can identify with and they came up with thirty seven we whittled that down to about ten and it took a year to do this that s a long time and you might want to ask why well if you just come up with the word honesty give me a break everybody wants the culture to be honest nobody is going to say i want to be lied to every day service what do you mean by service theres got to be a lot more depth in this than that and everybody talks about teamwork but there s a difference in level of teamwork that you see in an intramural sports team vs a baseball team how do you dive deeper into teamwork what are the things that don t work for a team a lot of it has to do with communication a lot has to do with things that people of study and you may one go deeper into that at zappos we thought about well there are a lot of smart people in this room when they re fighting with each other and trying to figure out who s right and who s not its probably not the best use of time we wanted everyone to build off each other and help each other make any idea better the result is that the company gets a better idea not that any individual person is right so we wanted to make and still this idea that it s company first then your department then your the team then yourself and how do you do that we are going to go a level deeper in that there s another great element of high performing teams that i really like which is this pyramid that was created by patrick lencioni and he wrote this book the five dysfunctions of a team and the reason this is interesting is he talks about the breakdowns of the team a lot of teams break down because they have no trust and even if you had trust why do you need trust if you have trust you can actually have debates and conflict and get to the right answer if you don t have conflicts and debate it s the blind leading the blind how do you actually know you got to the right answer before you commit to something so people are not actually wanting to commit they re afraid of committing lets say you get to the next level when you are actually able to commit what goes wrong then it s usually because people are not held accountable to things that they committed to and if people are not held accountable to the things that they committed to then they cant get results if you think about the company as a black box and results whether it s financial whether you produce a great product or anything like that as the output one of the major inputs is the culture of the company some other best practices we are actually going to talk though in the q and a because i think they are going to blend into the conversation is that you want to incorporate your mission into your values we talked about that performance you need to think a bit harder deeper longer about your values than you might initially think you need to one of the things i think a lot of companies don t actually do is they interview for technical fit or skill fit a competency in that realm but they dont actually interview for the culture fit whether someone will actually believe in and follow the mission i think that is a big big no no i think you can have the smartest engineer in the world but if they don t believe the mission they are not going to pour their heart and soul into it and that s one of the things where if you actually start thinking about culture from the interview process to performance reviews to making sure thats a daily habit you get a lot further with making a great culture one final point made here culture just like customer service or fitness is like motherhood and apple pie everybody wants to provide great customer service every company wants to have great culture what they fail to do is make it a daily habit you just can t be fit if you don t do it as a daily habit eventually you get out of shape then you get fat and then you say oh i have to go on a crash diet to get back into shape that doesn t quite work and the same is true with something like culture so i think we checked all of these off so we can go into q and a with brian brian chesky hello everybody its quiet in here i ll be honest now i feel a little less on edge nothing worse than a room full of people really really quiet staring at you but now i feel better alfred lin well i did it for five or ten minutes you can do it a little longer so brian could you talk about the process by which you came to understand that culture was important to airbnb and building a company brian chesky yeah so i think one of the things we realized is to just give you i wont tell the full story of how airbnb came to be some of you may know it so heres the very short version the story airbnb wasn t meant to be the company we were trying to start i quit my job i was living in la one day i drove to san francisco became roommates with my friend from college from the rhode island school of design joe gebbia and i had one thousand dollars in the bank and the rent was one thousand one hundred and fifty dollars so that weekend this international design convention was coming to san francisco all the hotels were sold out so we decided to turn the house into a bed and breakfast for the conference i didnt have a bed joe had three air beds we pulled them out of the closet and called it the air bed and breakfast that s how the company started i recall the story ten thousand times by the way some version of that story and i didn t think i d ever tell that a second time i remember growing up i also went to college my parents were social workers and never thought about me going to art school they had worried that maybe i would not get a job after college which im sure most parents worry about make sure you promise me you get a job with health insurance i end up starting airbnb i remember her telling me i guess you never got the job with health insurance the reason i say this though is airbnb was never meant to be the big idea it was meant to be the thing to pay the rent so we could think of the big idea along the way by solving our problem it became the big idea so alongside that we wont touch on how we built a product that s probably another conversation that s being talked about you have to build a team and a great company and in the early days we had three co founders joe nate and myself i think of one of the reasons we re successful was that i was really lucky i don t think it was really lucky to pick up the idea airbnb and i dont think we were lucky to be successful once we had a team i think we could have come up with a lot of other ideas and been just as successful i think i was lucky in that i found two great people that i wanted to start up a business with people i admired that almost intimidated me by how smart they were i think that s what the first thing is to build a team that is so talented that they kind of slightly make you uncomfortable to be with them because you know you are going to have to raise your game to be with them and then when we were working together in the early days this is 2008 the first thing is we were like a family you think about founders like parents and the company like a child that child will manifest in many ways behaviors that parents have in the relationship if the parents are functional but not working together then the child is frankly going to be pretty fucked up you dont want that you want your culture to be awesome and so joe nate and i were a total family the beginning we usually worked eighteen hours a day seven days a week i remember when we were at y combinator we worked together we ate food together or even went to the gym together we may as well have gotten jumpsuit we didnt go that far it was like we were a mission a special force we had this amazing shared way of doing things with amazing accountability and that was the dna of a company and then we were thinking at some point you build the product to phase two which is building the company that builds the product so a lot of the talk is about how to build a product how to get product market fit once people do that now you have to build a company it doesn t matter how great your original product idea is if you cannot build a great company then your product will not endure as we thought about this we realized we wanted to build a company for the long term we wanted a company that would endure to do that we started noticing companies have something in common companies around for a really long time had a clear mission a clear sense of values and they had a shared way of doing something that was unique to them and was really special and so joe nate and i when we were three people decided to look around at companies i noticed apple steve jobs core value was that he believed people with passion could change the world he said our products change but our value never has we learned about amazon we learned about nike we learned about companies in the early days you can even use this to talk about nations even a nation has core values and a declaration so that the nation may endure longer we started to realize that we needed to have intention culture needs to be designed and that is how we got connected because we were funded by sequoia alfred just joined them with zappos and i was told zappos had an amazing culture we went to las vegas and met up with tony and we learned about it alfred lin so what did you learn brian chesky well you guys are crazy the thing we learned and we were three people was if culture is a way of doing things there really are two arts one is behaviors and those can change maybe fifty years from now there will be rituals and behaviors that change be different but there have to be some things that never change some principles some ideas that endure that make you you and i think of core values integrity honesty those arent core values those are values that everyone should have but there have to be like three five six things that are unique to you and you can probably think about this in your life what is different about you that every single other person if you could only tell them three or four things you would want them to know about you and we realized that when zappos was one hundred employees they wrote down these ten core values the thing i learned from tony is i wish i didnt wait until i was one hundred employees to write down a core value i was talking to sam he thinks we are the only company to write our core values down before we hired anyone alfred lin how long did it take you to hire your first employee brian chesky so the first employee was our first engineer i think we looked for him for four or five months i probably looked through thousands of people and interviewed hundreds of people alfred lin by then when you hired him when did you write it was it on day one or two or was it three brian chesky i think we started working on it around the time of y combinator which would ve been january 2009 it was probably a process that evolved over the course of six to seven months we finished y combinator in april 2009 hired our first engineer in july something like that probably six months some people ask why did you spend so much time on hiring your first engineer i think bringing in your first engineer is like bringing in a dna chip to the company this person if we re successful there were going to be a thousand people just like him or her in that company it still wasn t a matter of getting somebody to build the next three features we need the ship for users there was something much more long term and much more enduring which was do i want to work with one hundred thousand more people like this now you want diversity to play you want diversity of background age you don t want diversity of values you want very homogenous beliefs thats the one thing that shouldnt be diverse alfred lin so what were these values brian chesky six core values ill talk about maybe three of them so the first core value we talk about is champion in mission and what it really means is that we want to hire people that are here for a mission we dont want people here because they think we have a great valuation they like our office design they need a job or they think its hot we want people to be here for the one thing that will never change and thats our mission and just to tell you a quick story about our mission airbnb a lot of people describe it as a way to book a room or book a house and travel around the world and thats what we do but that is not why we do it to answer the question on what our mission is is to tell you a story i think it describes it in 2012 i met a host named sebastian we do these new jobs around the world where we do meet ups sebastian is probably late fifties in north london sebastian looks at me and says brian there is this word you never use on your website and i say what s that word and he says that word is friendship i would love to read a story about friendship i said okay read me a story about friendship he says six months ago the brunt of riots broke out in front of my home and i was very scared the next day my mom called me to make sure i was ok i said yeah mom im ok and she goes what about the house he says the house is ok as well he said here s the interesting thing from the time the riots broke out to the time my mom called me was a twenty four hour window of time in the periods between that time seven of my previous airbnb guests called me just to make sure i was okay he said think about that seven of my own guests called me before my own mother did i think that says more about his mother than his guests but in this summer on a typical night or a peak night we wouldhave four hundred twenty five thousand people staying in homes and living together and they were coming from a hundred and ninety different countries in the world which is every country except north korea iran syria cuba so just hearing that story at our core that is what we are about thats much more than just booking a room or traveling that what we are about is we want to help bring the world together we want to do that by giving a sense of belonging anywhere you go our mission is to belong anywhere so five years from now twenty years from now maybe we re still selling rooms and homes to meet in or not but i can guarantee you we re always going be about a sense of belonging and bringing people together and that s the more enduring idea so when we hire people the first thing to make sure it is that if that is your mission you need to champion your mission you champion the mission by living the mission do you believe in it do you have stories about it do you use the product do you believe in the product i used to ask crazy questions one of the crazy questions sam reminds me of i use to interview people so i interviewed the first three hundred employees at airbnb which people think im really neurotic and they may also be true i used to ask them a question if you had a year left to live would you take this job i amended it people who say yes probably don t like their families so i changed it to ten years i feel like you should use whatever time you have left to live whatever you want to do in those last ten years you should just do i really want you to think about that that was enough time for you to do something you really cared about and the answer doesn t have to be this company i say fine if what youre meant to do is travel or start a company just do that don t come here go do that so there is this old parable about two men laying bricks somebody comes up to the first man and says what are you doing im building a wall he asks the other guy he says im building a cathedral there s a job and there is a calling we want to hire people not only looking for jobs but a calling and that s the first value champion the mission i dont want to take all the time i will talk about just one more the second value relates to being frugal and i will tell you a story by the way all the founding stories of your company end up becoming the things that you keep talking about to thousands of people kind of like a child that these things keep coming back later in life so airbnb i think marc andreessen said in the last talk that it was the worst idea that ever worked i remember people thinking we were crazy i remember telling people about the idea i actually told paul graham i said we have this idea its called airbnb he asked people are actually doing this i said yeah question was what s wrong with them so i knew the interview wasn t going well and in the interview paul graham i think wasn t going to accept us and we told the story of how we funded the company and here s how it goes we re introduced michael seibel who is a partner of y combinator introduced me and joe to like fifteen investors in the valley including some of the ones that have been here and all of them said no to the company they could have bought ten percent of the company for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars they all said no they thought it was crazy no one would ever stay in someone s home so we ended up funding the company with credit cards and you know those binders kids in school put baseball cards in we had to put them in those we had to put them somewhere thats how many credit cards we had and we were completely in debt and in the fall of 2008 we provided housing for the democratic and republican national convention we had this crazy idea because we weren t selling a lot of homes in the year after we launched we had a hundred people a day visiting our website and two bookings which is generally bad its like releasing a song and a year later three people are listing to it a day its probably not going to be a very popular song but i believed in it joe and nate believed in it so we are completely in debt right and we get this idea we are an air bed and breakfast providing housing for the democratic republican national convention what if we made a breakfast cereal for like the democratic national convention and we came up with this obama themed cereal and we called it obama os the breakfast of change then we came up with a republican themed cereal for john mccain we found out he was a captain in the navy so we came up with captain mccains a maverick in every bite we had zero dollars and without any money we tried calling general mills they told us to stop calling them or they would get a restraining order so that didn t work we found a local though an alumni of risd who made a thousand boxes deal for us we ended up sending them to press and eventually within a week it got on national television national news we made forty thousand dollars selling breakfast cereal in 2008 we made five thousand dollars from our website and we made forty thousand dollars selling breakfast cereal i remember my mom asking so are a you cereal company now and that wasn t that bad part the bad part was the honest answer which was technically yes but the reason i tell that is our second core value is to be a cereal entrepreneur i m sorry for the cheesy pun but be a cereal entrepreneur we really mean is that we believe constraints bring out the creativity when you raise eight hundred million dollars suddenly all that scrappiness it s easy to lose that scrappiness its easier for people to tell you i just need this fifty thousand dollar contract i need this i need that when people are desperate and not being a little bit frugal not being creative or tell me they can t do something i ll just take a box of cereal and even the suggestion of obama os is you need to be scrappy and frugal so again a lot of the founding dna of your company becomes these values these principles everyone knows that if you don t give a crap you shouldn t be here and it doesn t mean you have to give a crap it just means you have to to be here you also have to be creative to be an entrepreneur and super scrappy and these are some of the values we learned alfred lin so you guys should start to think about questions when we open up to questions from the audience but i have a few more questions to ask so this all sounds nice stories are great the people here are a pretty skeptical group its a cs department class probably left brain focused this feels like a softie right brain focus how does having a strong culture help you make important tough decisions brian chesky well i think that having it so here s the thing about culture there are three things they never tell you about culture first thing is they never tell you anything about culture no one talks about culture and no one ever tells the need to have strong culture so there s tons of articles about building a great product there s tons of articles on growth and adaption and a few things about culture its a mystical thing that s soft and fuzzy that s the first problem the second problem is it is hard to measure things that are hard to measure often get discounted these are two very hard things the third thing the biggest problem it doesn t pay off in the short term if you wanted to start up a company and sell it in one year the one thing i would tell you to do is fuck up the culture just hire people quickly culture makes you hire really slowly makes you deliberate about your decisions that in the near term can slow progress putting an investment into the company short term first thing is the need to be very clear about what s unique to you that you stand for once you do that you need to hire people that believe in that you need to make sure you hire and fire based on these values one thing we do is constantly repeat over and over again when we interview we want to make sure they are world class and fit the culture the first thing i used to ask people at the end of the interview i would say if you can hire this is a functional question if you could hire anybody in the world would you hire the person sitting across from you if our vision is the best in the world why arent we hiring the best in the world every single person is meant to hire a person better than the previous people you are constantly raising the bar then we have separate people called core values interviewers who arent in the function so it you are an engineer the core values interviewers are never engineers because we don t want them to be biased and say well i know how good they are and they interview just for values to make sure that people care about the same thing and we said no to a lot of really great people because we just didn t feel right about them being with us long term so that s one of the things some other examples of when we have had to make hard decisions in mid 2011 we were mostly united states and we had this internet clone funded by these guys called the samwer brothers anyone ever hear of them they basically clone internet companies they recently went public they take american websites and clone them and then quickly try to sell them back to you its kind of like putting a gun to your head so they had done this to groupon groupon was the fastest growing site in the world ever they stopped doing groupon and started cloning us and this is back when we had forty employees we had raised seven million dollars they cloned us and in thirty days they hired four hundred people and they wanted to sell the company and if they couldnt they were going to destroy us around the world the problem with airbnb is if we are not everywhere around the world a travel site not being in europe is like your phone not having email it doesn t actually work so we were kind of in trouble we had this conversation it was a pragmatic decision of should we acquire them and then there was the values decision the pragmatic one probably said buy them because you can t risk losing international so just guarantee you are going to get international we ended up not buying them the reason we ended up not buying them was i just didn t like the culture i didnt want to bring in those four hundred people i felt like we were missionaries and they were mercenaries i didn t feel like they were doing it for the beliefs i thought they were doing it to make a lot of money very quickly i believed in a war missionaries would outlast and endure mercenaries i also felt like the best revenge against an internet clone was just to make them run the company long term you had the baby now you ve got to raise it so that s what we ended up doing and that was a very controversial decision a lot of people were telling me you should buy this company we didn t and i think it worked out alfred lin what percentage of revenue comes from europe brian chesky more than fifty percent alfred lin i think it worked out okay anybody have any questions i can keep going no one one statement we had at zappos is culture and brand were two sides of the same coin airbnb has a great culture and a great brand do you care to talk about branding its kind of a weak thing it s a value we don t tend to focus on brian chesky i actually just said that to sam i think silicon valley is not historically really strong or we don t talk about culture and brand very much they are two sides of the same coin so culture like the principles and the beliefs you have inside a company that you want people to be aligned with long term whatever happens inside the company eventually comes out you cant hold it in and brand is really the promise outside the company that everyone identifies with so i think having a clear mission and making sure that you know that mission and the mission comes through the company is probably the best thing you can do for both culture and values and then the second thing you know is that your brand the way people think about you and your company is often decided by your brand evangelists who are your employees if you have a weak culture we often think that companies that hire employees people that are deeply passionate create companies that customers are really passion about those are companies with strong brands and so zappos had a really strong brand a lot of companies google that cared deeply about culture they actually have a question is this person google which is meant to be like the catch all for the digital culture it was a very strong culture google has a unique there s no such thing as a good or bad culture its either a strong or weak culture and a good culture for someone else may not be a good culture for you so i think brand is incredibly important as well brand is really the connection of you with your customers and so if you have an incredibly strong culture the brand will come through the final thing to say about brand is a lot of people that talk about their brand talk about what they sell so if youre apple one way of doing the same we sell computers and the new screens are larger and faster and they talk about bits and bytes i remember steve jobs had this really important talk where he says the way to win this is 1997 isn t to talk about bits and bytes the way to win is talk about what we value what our core values are we believe passionate people can change the world and that was how they introduced a different campaign so apple before they had this huge renaissance became the most valuable company in the world they did the think different campaign which is basically saying this is what we believe in that if you buy an apple computer you re also saying i believe in this too and there has to be a deeper core belief and if that doesnt happen youre a utility and utilities get sold at commodity prices alfred lin the question is how do you know how to communicate this company culture or core value to the outside world brian chesky so the question is how do you communicate what airbnb does in the earlier days well we learned a lot because in the early days we communicated like a utility we actually said airbnb is a cheap affordable alternative to hotels our tag line was forget hotels save money with airbnb and over time we felt like that was this was way back in the day we felt like that was way too limiting that it undercut the idea we changed our tag line to travel like a human which we havent kept but it was basically meant to say that we believe in a certain kind of world and we really feel like travel is mass produced you feel isolated you feel like a stranger and we want to bring the world back to the place where it feels like a village again where the service is coming from other people where you have this feeling you belong and you are treated like a human no matter how successful you are in life often traveling will remind you that you are not that successful go through tsa stay in a typical hotel sometimes you ll have some problems we really wanted to make people feel special this is some of the stuff we did in the early days we did a lot of storytelling i mean i ve probably told the story of airbnb ten thousand times and this is a something that is kind of related to culture someone asked me the other day whats the job of the ceo there are lots of things a ceo does but what you mostly do is articulate the vision to articulate a vision you have to develop a strategy and hire people that fit the culture if you do those three things you basically have a company and that company will hopefully be successful if you have the right vision a good strategy and the people to get there and so what you end up doing is articulating the vision over and over whether its recruiting talking to investors getting funding doing pr interviews speaking in a class room you are always reinforcing the values youre doing it in an email to a customer you just do it a thousand times it changes and gets better and better every time so it kind of evolved very good question how do we make sure the hosts are reinforcing the culture of airbnb so the answer to that is we do a pretty good job but not yet an amazing job at that when we first founded airbnb i took the craig newmark school of thought craig is the founder of craigslist anyone should be able to use airbnb if you want to rent your place you should be able to it turns out many people believe in our values because we talked about them and believed them but there were people who rented on airbnb not because they believed in the values but instead because they realized they could make a lot of money renting their home and not everyone was a great culture fit these people actually did cause us a lot of problems so this was a lesson for me i didn t think it didnt occur to me in the early days that the hosts had to completely fit our values we met them we attract people like us we realized hosts are like partners and they need to believe in the same culture we do so now we have this program called the super host program where they have to demonstrate values to reach this kind of badge which gets the priority customer support and distribution we are having this important host convention where we bring all the hosts in and will be talking about reinforcing our values so the answer is we were really late but we now do it by reinforcing it every step of the way q brian airbnb has made some great contributions to the open source community do you have any thoughts on how that contributes to your culture and company values brian chesky yeah i think just in general it may be related to two things about airbnb we tend to be a pretty open culture just in general we believe in a shared world where people are giving back contributing to making communities and industries stronger its my philosophy to talk about everything internally except for things that relate to customer or client privacy if it doesnt relate to those two things then we will talk about it as far as open source culture and engineering we wanted to make sure that we had a really strong identification of the team and so we really felt like a lot of source code shouldn t be you know we felt like every company needs some kind of moat that protects you from your competition we thought some technology would be but we also felt like we wanted to give back from a technology standpoint we preferred our moat to be that we provide the very best experience in the world when you use airbnb that has the biggest network effects we thought that kind of took precedent over some of the technology that we use so we decided to try to share some of that out to people i think it does relate to the values i never recommended i never one day recommended we do any of that we hired engineers that we thought shared our values in culture and they felt that was the right thing to do q you talk about conventions what did you do when you had no money and you only got paid for those who used your site what did you do to scale that up how did you get users to the site brian chesky so this is not about culture but i will answer it anyway the best advice i ever got was probably from paul graham paul graham said i remember he had this line it s better to have a hundred people that love you than to have a million people that just sort of like you it s literally better to have a hundred people love you and the reason why if you have one million customers one million users and they just kind of don t care about you but they use your app and think you re okay to get them to care is a really hard thing i dont know how to get a million people to all of a sudden care but i do know if you get a hundred people who love you those people if they feel incredibly passionate they will go out and eacb tell a hundred people all movements that lead to companies or ideas start with just a hundred people so the reason this is so critical is he gave us another lesson which is that if all you need do is get a hundred people to love you is do things that dont scale so it s hard if you ve got a million people you can t you meet them all you can meet a hundred people you can spend time with them so that s exactly what we did joe nate and i would go door to door in new york city or in denver where the democratic national convention was literally staying and living with our users it s a joke that when you buy an iphone steve jobs does not come sleep on your couch but i will that was really critical living with our users all we had to do was get in with them and share a passion with our users you work backwards from a hundred people even one person but with our new technology imagine what would be an amazing experience for just this one person walk through the journey from that one person make it perfect for that one person once you make it perfect for one person it s actually really easy to make a service easy for one person its not that hard where everyone gets in trouble is they try to solve both at the same time so the first thing we did was went door to door that is one thing that set up memories i will give one more example before i stop talking about this right now with airbnb you can click a button and put in your home and a professional photographer comes to your home and photographs it for free we have five thousand photographers around the world and we have photographed hundreds of thousands of homes so it is the probably one of the largest on demand photography groups around i believe this started with joe and i we were staying with this one host in new york city and her house is amazing but her photos were terrible so we asked why you dont put up better photos this is before the life of the great cameras 2008 she couldnt figure out how to get photos from her phone onto her computer she wasnt a very technically savvy woman and i just said we will just take photos for you actually i said what if you could press a button and somebody would show up at your door to take professional photographs she said that would be magic so the next day i knock on her door going im here i photographed her home i sent a few emails to people saying we give this new magical photography service and if you want you can press the button for a professional photographer to show up at your home so they would hit this button and it would send me this alert we rented a camera in brooklyn and in january 2009 walking through the snow we photographed peoples homes we did this by hand without any technology we managed that with spreadsheets i wasnt going to bother nate to design something for photography then we started hiring contract photographers eventfully we got an intern to manage all the contract photographers then we made a full time position to manage the other interns of the contract employees and at some point this is before we built anything at some point there were too many people to manage there were like hundreds of photographers then we built all the tools to do all the photography but we did it only after we knew what the perfect service was q one more question the question is in this particular situation with airbnb a lot of people think it is not necessarily a technology company but more of a marketing company brian chesky good question i will answer the question with a story alfred lin let me preface that question with a series of questions do you today have propriety technology brian chesky yes alfred lin do you have a moat brian chesky yes alfred lin do you have network effects brian chesky yes alfred lin do you have pricing power brian chesky yes alfred lin do you have a good brand brian chesky i think so alfred lin are you a monopoly brian chesky i am not going to answer that one alfred lin getting back to the question just forgetting about all of that companies that have network effects and sort of get off the ground the fly wheel is going people just think you are lucky brian chesky let me just answer that one its a totally fair question and people have said it so i want to answer it the guy who owns sequoia capital his name is doug leone one day i think it was a year year and half ago he says your job sucks and i was all what the hell does that mean he says you have the worst job of any ceo in my portfolio i said tell me why and this is what he said first of all you are a technology company and i would say that at our heart we are a technology company so you have all the challenges of all the other portfolio companies but beyond that you are in a hundred and ninety different countries so you have to figure out how to be international you have to hire in every country in the world we are literally in every country except north korea iran syria and cuba we are a payments company we handle billions of dollars of transactions a year we had to get a business license in the state of california we have serious fraud and risk it needs to be locked down like fort knox he said thats usually where companies end but you have to worry about all the other crap trust and safety we have four hundred and twenty five thousand people staying in other people s individual beds in their sheets think about a woman from texas staying in the middle east or vice versa think about the cultural conflicts that could happen and misunderstandings you have four hundred and twenty five thousand people a night its like being the mayor of oakland so imagine you are the mayor of oakland and all the things that happened in oakland tonight you have trust and safety now we have regulatory problems we are in thirty thousand different cities every city has different rules different laws and many were written in a different century they were written before you had all the technology then you have issues like search and discovery google has this thing about being really good at search google can give me all these results but its clear that there is only one or two right answers for everybody we have forty thousand homes in paris there is no best home in paris for anyone in this room so we have to be really really great at matching people and technology another example facebook is a digital product their product is their website our product is these experiences that you have in the real world we are not just an online product but also an offline product so basically the long and the short of it is we have to be world class at technology world class at design we have to be world class at branding we have to convince government we are good for their neighborhood because we have to convince people that we are not crazy this is a real thing we have to make sure trust and safety is world class we handle all these payments and handle risk and i didnt even mention culture this was not about culture i really do not see it as a marketing company alfred lin thank you brian chesky thank you guys 5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics are a transcript of a lecture discussing company culture,

I can’t stop wondering what the northern lights look like in person.,i bloom i wilt like a flower in the wild i find guidance in the glow of northern light i breathe indeed and i close my eyes i search i see over mountains i fly high lights will guide me into oceans i dive lights will guide me lights will guide me lights will guide me home lights will guide me home i rise i fall like water from the sky i grinch i roar like a storm that never dies  i breathe indeed and i close my eyes i search i see over mountains i fly high lights will guide me into oceans i dive lights will guide me lights will guide me lights will guide me home lights will guide me home over mountains i fly high lights will guide me,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,"The song's lyrics resonate well with the user's sense of wonder about the northern lights, reflecting a strong emotional alignment.

My teammate keeps blaring voice notes on speaker in the open office; I swear earbuds were invented for a reason.,maybe there are cartwheels in your mouth maybe your words will grow up to be a gymnasts maybe you have been kicking people with them by accident i know some people get a whole lot of rocking in the rocking chair and the ones who dont sometimes get rocks in their voice boxes and their voice boxes become slingshots maybe you think my heart looks like a baby squirrel but you absolutely missed when you told the class i have head lice cause i one hundred percent absolutely do not have head lice and even if i do it is a fact that head lice prefer clean heads over dirty ones so i am clean as a whistle on a tea pot my mother says it is totally fine if i blow off steam as long as i speak in an octave my kindness can still reach my kindness knows mermaids never ever miss their legs in the water cause there are better ways to move through the ocean than kicking so guess what if i ever have my own team i am picking everyone first even the worst kid and the kid with the stutter like a skipping record cause i know all of us are scratched even if you cant hear it when we speak my mother says most people have heartbeats that are knocking on doors that will never open and i know my heart is a broken freezer chest cause i can never keep anything frozen so no i am not always crying i am just thawing outside of the lines and even if i am always crying it is a fact that salt is the only reason everything floats so good in the dead sea and just cause no one ever passes notes to me doesnt mean i am not super duper in fact my super duper might be a buoy or a paper boat the next time your nose gets stuck up the river cause it is a fact that our hearts stop every for a milli second every time we sneeze and some peoples houses have too much dust some peoples fathers are like attics ive heard attics have monsters in their walls and shaky stares i think if i lived in a house with attic id nightmare a burglar in my safety chest and maybe id look for rest in the sticks and stones cause my mother says a person can only swallow so much punch before hes drunk on his own fist but the only drunk i ever knew was sleeping in the alley behind our church and jesus turned water into his wine so even god has his bad days but on your bad days couldnt you just say hey im having a bad day instead of telling me im stupid or poor or telling me i dress like a boy cause maybe i am a boy and a girl maybe my name is andrea andrew so what it is a fact that bumblebees have hair on their eyes and humans also should comb though everything they see like an anchorman is not a sailor like the clouds might be a pillow fight like my mother says every bird perched on a telephone wire will listen to the conversations running through its feet to decide the direction of its flight so i know every word we speak can make hurricanes in peoples weather veins or shine their shiny shine so maybe sometime you could sit beside me on the bus and i could say guess what it is a fact that manatees have vocal chords but do not have ears and beethoven made music even when he could no longer hear and i know every belt that has hit someones back is still a belt that was built to hold something up and it is fact that egyptians slept on pillows made of stone but its not hard for me to dream that maybe one day youll write me back like the day i wrote the lightening bug to say i smashed my mason jar and i threw away the lid i didnt want to take a chance that id grow up to be a war i want to be a belly dance or an accordion or a pogo stick or the fingerprints the mason left in the mortar between the bricks to prove that he was here that he built a roof over someones head to keep the storm from their faith my mother says thats why we all were born and i think shes right so write back soon sincerely yours 1,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.5,"The recommended song lyrics are abstract and poetic, focusing on personal expression and resilience against verbal attacks or misunderstandings. Emotional alignment scores a 2 as the lyrics touch on the frustration of being misunderstood or misjudged, which loosely connects to the user's frustration with their teammate's behavior. However, the connection is tenuous and indirect. Contextual relevance scores a 1 because the lyrics do not specifically address the issue of noise in the workplace or the use of earbuds, which is central to the user's prompt. Lyrical coherence scores a 2 as the lyrics, while creative and expressive, are somewhat disjointed and may be difficult for the user to relate directly to their situation regarding workplace etiquette and noise levels. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional state or contextual needs regarding their specific workplace annoyance."
Opened the fridge and the sour-milk smell nearly knocked me over.,i had a shock when the whirring of the city street it seemed to increase i have a lock i have a roof a rug for my bare feet still there is unease where i had swept the broken glass from the hallway floor i acted too late the city crept through the opening beneath the door to lie in wait your jacking is keeping me awake i m telling you for the last time to roll down your sleeves it s true there s a hundred million boys that i could slime if you let me leave,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the user's prompt about a strong sour-milk smell from the fridge. The emotional alignment is low as the song discusses a general feeling of unease and disturbance, which is not directly related to disgust or repulsion typically elicited by a bad smell. Contextually, the song speaks more about urban life and personal disturbances rather than a specific incident related to smell or household experiences. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, with a clear narrative about urban discomfort and personal boundaries, but they do not connect well with the user's experience of an overwhelming smell. Overall, the song does not effectively match the emotional or contextual needs of the user's prompt."
"I started presenting, then realized the slide on screen was upside down—facepalm moment.",what s going on could this be my understanding it s not your fault i was being too demanding i must admit it s my pride that made me distant all because i hoped that you d be someone different there s not much i know about you fear will always make you blind but the answer is in clear view it s amazing what you ll find face to face i turned away because i thought you were the problem tried to forget until i hit the bottom but when i faced you in my blank confusion i realized you weren t wrong it was a mere illusion it really didn t make sense just to leave this unresolved it s not hard to go the distance when you re finally gettin involved face to face,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,"The song lyrics discuss themes of misunderstanding and realization, which loosely align with the user's experience of making a mistake during a presentation. However, the emotional tone of the song, which seems to delve into deeper interpersonal issues and self-reflection, doesn't closely match the lighter, possibly humorous embarrassment of the user's situation. Contextually, the song's focus on personal relationships and introspection doesn't directly relate to the professional or presentation setting of the user's anecdote. The lyrics themselves are coherent and well-constructed, maintaining a clear narrative about facing truths and resolving misunderstandings."
Just snagged last-minute seats for the semifinal—can’t keep still.,congratulations for making it this far you ve officially reached the end of the album if you re not drunk yet please refer shouldn t i be out of diapers by now ,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not align with the user's emotional state of excitement and anticipation for a sports semifinal. The lyrics seem to be a closing remark for an album and mention unrelated topics such as being drunk and diapers, which do not fit the context of attending a sports event. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent as standalone sentences but do not form a cohesive message relevant to the user's situation."
Someone knocked on the door at midnight and then went silent; my heart’s racing.,i ve been waiting for some time cause tonight she is mine yeah i called her on the phone what she said turned me on she said no boys til midnight so i walked to her house just to see what she s about when i knocked on her door i heard her say once more she said no boys till midnight she said no boys til midnight no boys til midnight no boys til midnight she said no boys til midnight she said no boys til midnight she said no boys no boys no boys,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.5,"The recommended song does not align well with the emotional intensity and suspense of the user's prompt. The user's scenario involves anxiety and surprise, whereas the song is about anticipation and a playful interaction. Contextually, the mention of 'midnight' and 'knocking on the door' loosely connects to the prompt, but the overall theme diverges significantly. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and lack depth, affecting their coherence and ability to convey a clear, engaging narrative."
Got home drenched from the rain and found a thermos of hot tea waiting on my desk—little gestures like that rescue a day.,my tea s gone cold i m wondering why i got out of bed at all the morning rain clouds up my window and i can t see at all and even if i could it d all be grey but your picture on my wall it reminds me that it s not so bad it s not so bad i drank too much last night got bills to pay my head just feels in pain i missed the bus and there ll be hell today i m late for work again and even if i m there they ll all imply that i might not last the day and then you call me and it s not so bad it s not so bad and i want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life push the door i m home at last and i m soaking through and through then you handed me a towel and all i see is you and even if my house falls down now i wouldn t have a clue because you re near me and i want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life and i want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life34,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.3,"The song lyrics reflect the emotional tone of the user's prompt quite well, capturing the transformation from a dreary, challenging day to a moment of warmth and gratitude, similar to the user's experience of finding comfort in a small gesture. The context of coming home to a comforting scenario is directly mirrored in the song's narrative of finding solace and appreciation in personal connections, aligning well with the user's situation. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear, fluent story of overcoming daily struggles through meaningful personal relationships, enhancing the emotional and contextual relevance of the song to the prompt."
"Every corner of the house still echoes dad’s jokes, and he’s not here anymore.",the buzzing of the house has disappeared the glow is dimmed and contact s lost voices faces who were here the corner of the room was on and nothing else was needed no one else required nothing happens now it s all gone quiet for all intents for all our trust what was ever true the daily grind it sprang to life watching what was on instead of watching out the hours and hours and time to change i realise i m one of all the same but when i see you soon remind me how you lit up every room you knew that you were needed you talked and never tired how does it feel now that you ve been retired ,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song captures the emotional essence of missing a vibrant presence that once filled the house, similar to the user's sentiment about their dad's jokes echoing around the home. The lyrics reflect on the quiet that has settled in a place once lively, aligning well with the user's emotional state. Contextually, the song is relevant as it discusses the absence of a once dynamic and essential presence, paralleling the user's experience of loss. The lyrical coherence is moderate; while the lyrics are evocative and thematic, they can be somewhat disjointed and cryptic, making the narrative flow slightly challenging to follow."
The scholarship acceptance email just landed—I’m practically floating.,i found harris to be most entertaining to me when he s most angry at me and i found that the quickest way to get him crazy is to fuck with him on facebook he does not like it he s got his little updates meticulously planned like just became a big fan of will smith so i ll write up there fuck will smith and he ll be like why d you do that and so one time i noticed he was posting a lot on a study group for his world history class and i was like i know what i ll do i ll join the study group and i ll write all this dumb shit on there harris will get really pissed and it ll be awesome and that s exactly how that shit went down as soon as i started posting i started getting all these angry im s from harris like hey man you need to get off the boards i d be like why and he s like the admins are getting on my case and he posts this conversation he has with the admin where the admin is like hey harris who s aziz and he s like my cousin why do you ask and he goes he s posting on ap world wall do you know what period he has ap world and harris writes in all caps nooooooo you gotta boot him now with like thirty o s thirty w s and fifty exclamation points and other people are starting to get suspicious of my presence on the board as well only because i m supposed to be in the ninth grade and i have a full beard but i m trying to act like i belong right like i m in the class and i know what s up so i noticed some controversy about some quiz question and i said i know what i ll do i ll go and independently do some research and i ll post my findings on the board they ll think i m smart and that i belong in the class so the next post i wrote was guys i ve been doing some research i think the views on christianity and buddhism are far from similar and buddhism salvation is something you can only achieve from the noble eightfold path where as in christianity salvation is something to all those who accept jesus christ as their savior quote for whomever calls on the name of the lord shall be saved romans 10 13 i hate to say it guys but our teacher mr edelstein is right bam and then i waited like two minutes and then i posted this guys i just got an email from mr edelstein he read what i wrote here and gave me an extra point on the quiz he said i showed initiative and critical thinking skills what a cool guy and then this kid replied whatttttt and then at this point harris got fucking furious he was like i don t know if you should have posted that last wall post aziz and i was like why he says what if people go in tomorrow and say hey i heard you gave aziz an extra point on the quiz can i get an extra point back too cause i put the same thing he did and he d be like i don t teach aziz that person doesn t exist and i was like fuck you harris i do exist and then he starts attacking me publicly on the board like writing in all caps aziz get out this group with like a bunch of exclamation points and emoticons that are like and i was like what s that supposed to be harris you eating cinnabon all day and then i start mounting my offensive i start poking him like crazy and sending him vampire requests whatever the fuck that is and he s like i don t know what s going on and then he writes up there he goes hey everyone if i were you i wouldn t go to edelstein and ask to get the points back because i m positive you won t get the points back and i respond like no guys i just got another email from edelstein again you ll definitely get the points back just mention my name and the fact that i exist fuck you harris and then this kids writes you re not even in this class you re the guy from that tv show and some other kid writes what tv show are you on and i write gossip girl and then i got kicked the fuck out ,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics are a comedic narrative about pranking a friend on a Facebook study group, which does not align with the user's emotional state of joy and achievement from receiving a scholarship acceptance. The context of the lyrics, focusing on social media antics and classroom dynamics, is unrelated to the user's situation of receiving an important, life-changing email. The lyrics, while somewhat coherent in telling a specific story, are filled with slang, abrupt changes, and a conversational style that lacks the fluency and structured coherence typically found in song lyrics. Overall, the song does not match the user's emotional state or context, and the lyrics are not particularly coherent in a traditional lyrical sense."

However, the emotional alignment is low (scored at 1) because the song does not capture the specific anxiety or nervousness of waiting outside an exam hall; instead, it delves into themes of musical dedication and success. The lyrical coherence is also low (scored at 1), as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, lacking a clear narrative or fluency that would make the song's message comprehensible and relevant to the user's situation."
The sky finally cleared after days of rain—feels like good things are coming.,you came like the sun shining down weather was good we re just fine somewhere to rest my tired legs hope you can wait for things to change it s about this side of mine of mine i am not that far behind behind,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The recommended song captures the emotional uplift felt by the user, as indicated by the mention of the sun shining down, which aligns well with the clearing skies in the user's prompt. This suggests a sense of optimism and renewal, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on themes of change and rest, somewhat relevant to the user's feeling of anticipation for good things, but it doesn't directly address the end of a rainy period or the specific sense of new beginnings, which slightly lowers the contextual score. The lyrics, while somewhat poetic, lack a clear and fluent narrative, making them a bit disjointed and harder to follow, which affects the coherence score."
Saw my app featured on the store’s front page—cheeks hurt from smiling.,i stopped off at the grocery store to pick up a few things and i was reaching for some cheerios when i heard someone say my name i knew exactly who it was my heart started to race i turned around my legs got weak when i saw her face there stood the girl that broke my heart just a year ago i thought that i was over her but little did i know that running into her like that would leave me in a total mess wishing that we never said goodbye and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she ran over and hugged my neck i didn t want her to let go she smiled and said i looked just like a kid with my box of cheerios we laughed and talked about old times which wasn t all that smart cause it just left me with an emptiness when she pushed away her cart and if i wasn t standing in that store i might have laid right on that floor and cried i heard that voice i saw that smile clean up on aisle five she walked away looked back and smiled clean up on aisle five,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of joy and pride from seeing their app featured. The song's narrative focuses on a melancholic encounter with a past love, which contrasts sharply with the user's celebratory mood. Contextually, the song's setting in a grocery store and themes of heartbreak are unrelated to the user's experience related to technological achievement and success. The lyrics themselves are coherent and tell a clear story, hence the moderate score for lyrical coherence. Overall, the mismatch in both emotional and contextual aspects results in a low overall score."
Spent half an hour cursing the remote control until I realised I was pointing it at the wrong TV box—light-bulb moment.,i hate to be a nuisance here but i ve been waiting half a year to say you re bringing on the light the second hand moves way to slow where did all those minutes go i say you re bringing on the light oh yeah oh yeah bringing on the light oh yeah oh yeah bringing on the light there s no right way to do a wrong thing i could hear you say you re bringing on the right we ll there s a quick trip there and i m on return so make the grade or feel the burn you say you re bringing on the light there s a little place we used to go it took the place of what we didn t know it s like a magic show separating lies from fact oh what kind of fun is that you re just waiting for your time back go oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah bringing on the light,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.7,"The song captures a sense of frustration and waiting, which aligns with the user's experience of irritation with the remote control. However, the 'light-bulb moment' or realization aspect is only loosely connected through the repeated phrase 'bringing on the light,' which seems more metaphorical than literal. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent theme of waiting and realization, but they can be repetitive and vague, reducing their impact. Overall, the song partially matches the emotional tone and context but lacks a direct narrative connection to the specific scenario of the user."
The vet said the tests are normal—I can finally breathe again.,i can t breathe anymore why that is i m not sure i ve got my feet on the ground in fact i m flat on the floor my direction is lost i should pause to take stock it s a new one on me to even dream that you re free it s a tale without an end but the end is there for all to see and if the end weren t so real coming round and round again on me i guess it s all about my pride i want to be there at the kill but with or without god on my side i know that i really will1,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The emotional alignment of the song with the user's prompt is low. The user's prompt expresses relief and a sense of respite, whereas the song lyrics convey a sense of confusion, loss of direction, and an ongoing struggle, which does not reflect the user's newfound relief. Contextually, the song does not match the theme of receiving good news from a vet or any related scenario, as it discusses personal existential and emotional crises. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat fluent but may be difficult to follow due to their abstract and introspective nature, lacking a clear narrative or resolution."
"I laughed at his idea during the meeting, and guilt’s eating at me now.",i m sorry that joke flew right over your head that time it s not my fault it wasn t mine it s not my fault i couldn t tell if you were gonna laugh or cry at least when you were here i had someone to blame i had someone now it s not that easy and it s not the same well i m filing all the changes down i can turn the pages now i think i m doing okay by myself it just seems a little lonely now just a little while longer now to make myself understand how at least when you were here i had someone to blame i had someone now it s not that easy and it s not the same,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song captures the feeling of guilt and regret, aligning well with the user's emotional state of feeling guilty after laughing at someone's idea. The lyrics reflect a sense of loss and the difficulty of dealing with emotions alone, which resonates with the user's situation of dealing with guilt post the incident. However, the song's context is more about missing someone and dealing with changes, which isn't a perfect match for a professional meeting scenario, hence the slightly lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story of emotional struggle, though some lines might seem a bit disjointed or abstract, affecting the coherence score slightly."
The empty seat at our usual café table made the coffee taste bitter today.,a city full of people and my favorite is that waitress and she treats me like some type of common vagrant i see her every day but there s nothing to say unless i decide to step inside of that cafe i only get to sit if i buy something to eat otherwise it s best to keep my feet moving down that street and god damn she s a hard bitch talks at me like i m the bad dog that got into the garbage yeah i know that the toilet is for customers you ain t got to tangle up the strings to make this puppet work it doesn t have to be a game of patty cake but it ain t like you don t know i sleep in that alleyway and by the way i can see it in your eyes you re angry with your life not a stranger to the fight i bet you hate every man that you date and you re probably addicted to all types of escape you take it out on me that you re all alone when you know you got your own closet full of hollow bones watch the tone when you speak to old folks i m grown just trying to get out of this minnesota cold look lady i m homeless i m crazy i m so hopeless i m suicidal daily if you and i can t co exist let s fake it cause i ain t got the energy it takes for this relationship i m waiting for a city bus to flatten me and transport me to the ever after happily maybe reincarnated with luck come back to earth as a cockroach in your tip cup she said she s had it up to here she s gonna call authorities if i don t disappear i love her threats it rejuvenates my breath i give her stress for the reaction that it gets i got a pocket full of panhandled money on a cup of bad coffee and a stale honey bun in front of everyone she calls me bum but she notices my absence on them afternoons i don t come so here i am thorn in her hip holding down the corner table all morning with some corn chips ignoring the insults and evil eyes i feed off of em i wonder when she ll realize that she s the only reason i visit the only woman in my world that acknowledges my existence and if my ship ever comes i ll miss it because i m getting old and i ain t got much left to give it so there it is and i have to live with it i had the chance to make a difference but i didn t in the cafe bathroom drinking free tap water thinking damn i should ve been a better father to my daughter 7,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The recommended song lyrics depict a complex relationship between a homeless man and a waitress, focusing on themes of neglect, societal judgment, and personal regret. Emotional alignment scores a 2 as the song conveys a sense of loneliness and bitterness, which partially aligns with the user's feeling of bitterness due to the empty seat. However, the song's primary focus on the man's struggles and confrontations with the waitress diverges significantly from the user's emotional context of missing a specific person. Contextually, the song scores a 1 because, although it takes place in a café, the narrative and dynamics are quite different from the user's experience of missing someone familiar. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, scoring a 3, as they tell a clear story, but the heavy use of slang and abrupt changes in focus might make it harder for some listeners to follow."
Walked into the living room and everyone yelled “welcome back!”—did not see that coming.,i was hearing voices coming from the inside of the biggest sky that i had ever seen i could have sworn that they were talking to me saying something bout the way we used to be i started walking with my head on backwards trying to see exactly what i couldn t see till i ended back up in the place we started then i looked upstairs and i began to scream am i doing what i m s posed to tell me when i m getting closer ,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song lyrics chosen do not align well with the user's emotional experience of surprise and joy upon being unexpectedly welcomed back. The song's theme of confusion and seeking direction ('walking with my head on backwards') contrasts sharply with the user's experience of a positive surprise. Contextually, the song does not fit the scenario of a joyful reunion or welcome back moment. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but disjointed, reflecting a sense of disorientation which does not match the user's context. Overall, the song does not effectively mirror the emotions or the context of the user's described situation."
Seeing my younger cousin nail her first piano solo blew me away.,well it all began june 5th 1969 that was the day that i was born now i was born into a very very musical family so much so that i thought that since everybody around me could sing and play that everybody in the whole world could sing and play and it wasn t til i got into kindergarten that i realized that i was very wrong right around the time we were doing my country tis of thee sweet i realized that was not the case now uh as you ll see my mother is an ongoing theme in the show tonight one of the questions people ask me the most is how long have you been playing the piano and really i don t know we always had a piano in the house i am what you would consider to be self taught now what does that mean self taught that means i taught myself to play the piano now how d you do that brian i will tell you how i did that you see my mother is a classically trained pianist and when i told her i was interested in learrning to play the piano she s like oh great see now i can teach you the way that i was taught so i put my hands on the keys the first time and i did it the wrong way she pulls out a ruler and bop smacks me on the back of my hand so i said to myself okay i ma play football that s the end of that whole thing so what i did was i took the long route and taught myself to play now one of the very first songs actually the very first song i taught myself to play was this one and see if you remember this ,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,"The recommended song lyrics share a narrative about learning to play the piano, which aligns with the context of the user's prompt about a piano performance. However, the emotional tone of the song, which includes humor and a somewhat casual approach to learning piano, doesn't fully capture the awe and excitement expressed in the user's experience of witnessing a successful first piano solo. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story, but they focus more on self-teaching and the challenges faced rather than the triumph and joy of a first successful performance. Therefore, while there is some contextual relevance, the emotional alignment is not as strong."
My cat tried to pounce on its own shadow and face-planted into the rug; still chuckling.,i was alone on the sidewalk when you came when there wasn t anything that i wouldn t say somewhere there s an in between a place a place where my face hasn t been erased face this onward now i still got a box of pictures by the tree a cat on your lap and a tattoo on your knee you can sleep just pretend that i m dead i am alive but i wish i was instead face this onward now,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's prompt. The emotional tone of the song, which seems somber and reflective, does not match the light-hearted, humorous emotion conveyed by the user's experience of their cat's playful mishap. Contextually, the song's mention of a cat does not relate directly to the humorous scenario described, as the song's themes appear more focused on loss and reminiscence rather than playful or amusing incidents. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative flow, making them moderately coherent but not entirely fluent or easy to follow."
The airline lost my bag for the third time this year and acted like it wasn't a big deal.,so many took me for granted double crossed me for the bag when it landed i m thinkin you not the only fucking plug on this planet i m patient unfamiliar aircraft in sight,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's emotional alignment with the user's frustration about the airline losing their bag is minimal, as it primarily discusses betrayal and mistrust rather than frustration with a service. Contextually, the mention of an 'unfamiliar aircraft' loosely connects to the airline theme, but it doesn't specifically address the issue of lost luggage. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent theme of distrust and betrayal, though they may be somewhat cryptic and disjointed in their expression."
The kitchen tap drips every three seconds—can’t focus on anything else.,10 15 on a saturday night and the tap drips under the strip light and i m sitting in the kitchen sink and the tap drips drip drip drip waiting for the telephone to ring and i m wondering where she s been and i m crying for yesterday and the tap drips drip drip drip it s always the same,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,"The recommended song lyrics align well with the user's emotional and contextual prompt. Emotionally, the song captures a sense of frustration and distraction, similar to the user's inability to focus due to the dripping tap. Contextually, the song is highly relevant as it explicitly mentions the scenario of a dripping tap in a kitchen setting, mirroring the user's situation. The lyrics are coherent and create a vivid scene of waiting and distraction, though the repetitive structure might slightly hinder the overall fluency. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's described feelings and situation."
My roommate finally started rinsing the dishes instead of piling them up—honestly proud of that progress.,i feel so wholesome i could cry i got a chicken in my bandolier i ve hung it up to see if it would fall out i ve waited ages but now i m told these things take time him work here all day him got his tonsils sprayed him got no time for utensils or words to that effect i m deliberately diverging not the same but different you see i ve hung up to dry my legs hanging out someone said to sew up the bottoms but i can t reach and a fall would break my nose but still there s no harm in trying,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.67,"The song lyrics provided do not align well with the user's prompt about a roommate making progress by rinsing dishes. The emotional alignment is low because the song's tone of whimsy and randomness does not reflect the user's feeling of pride or satisfaction. Contextually, the lyrics are irrelevant, discussing chickens, bandoliers, and other unrelated topics without any connection to household chores or personal growth. The lyrical coherence is also low, as the lyrics are disjointed and lack a clear narrative or theme, making it difficult to extract a meaningful message that relates to the user's situation."
Spent half the night checking on my pup’s fever; I’m dead tired but can’t leave his side.,you know i m tired i got a fevered brow you know i d change if i were with her now you gave me drugs you said d cure my ills they may cure yours but mine are with me still if i were with her now if i were with her now if i were with her now,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's mention of tiredness and fever aligns well with the user's emotional state of exhaustion and concern for their feverish pup, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on themes of illness and seeking relief, which is somewhat relevant to the user's situation of caring for a sick pet, though the song's focus on human relationships and personal distress dilutes the direct relevance to the user's context with their pet. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the repetition and fragmented thoughts may reflect the user's tired mind, but it also makes the lyrics somewhat disjointed and harder to follow, reducing its overall effectiveness in conveying a clear narrative or sentiment."
The app keeps saying ‘unknown error’ and I have no clue what’s actually wrong; my brain’s spinning.,the buggy code of my internal workings keeps synced with my bad timing that s flaw the dead spot in between our ears keeps spreading when we stand up no one comes to ask why is this backwards the alarm doesn t go off after you re awake and especially that feeling you get when you meet someone who looks like you that one hundred dollar tip in a town or family without enough money to keep itself alive,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics chosen reflect a sense of frustration and confusion, which aligns well with the user's emotional state of feeling overwhelmed by an 'unknown error' and a 'spinning' brain. This earns a high score in emotional alignment. Contextually, the lyrics about 'buggy code' and 'bad timing' metaphorically match the theme of technical issues and mental disarray, though the connection to the specific scenario of an app error is somewhat indirect. The coherence of the lyrics is lower, as the narrative jumps between various disjointed scenarios and metaphors, making it harder to follow a clear, fluent message."
Saw a clip of glowing plankton beaches and now I’m itching to know everything about them.,i want to be on an island off the coast of mexico there s an island with tropical sand and boats and humans who light the nighttime sky with fire i wanna colour the sky take a dream with an ember that s dancing itself away from our circle on the beach while we watch bioluminescence make shapes inside the liquid living ocean i wanna swim inside the gulf of mexico1,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,"The song lyrics align well with the user's emotional state of curiosity and wonder about glowing plankton beaches. The mention of 'bioluminescence make shapes inside the liquid living ocean' directly connects to the user's interest in glowing plankton, scoring high in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat poetic and abstract, which slightly affects their coherence but still maintains a good sense of fluency and imagery, making it easy to visualize the scenes described."
All morning I’ve been day-dreaming about escaping to a quiet cabin in the woods—can almost smell the pine.,i didn t tell a soul where i was gonna be i just let em know i d be gone about a week the snow s been comin down for days the roads are closed but that s okay cause i m lost in caroline in the warmth of every whisper in the fire in her eyes while the cold wind blows outside i found what i ve been needin in this cabin in the colorado pines yeah i m lost in caroline with this mountain draped in gray there ain t much of a view and this weather s bound to break in a day or two if i see a sun come out i ll just pull the shades on down cause i m lost in caroline in the warmth of every whisper in the fire in her eyes while the cold wind blows outside i found what i ve been needin in this cabin in the colorado pines yeah i m lost in caroline while the cold wind blows outside i found what i ve been needin in this cabin in the colorado pines yeah i m lost in caroline i m so lost in caroline,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,"The song aligns well emotionally with the user's desire for a serene escape, capturing a sense of solitude and peace in a cabin surrounded by nature. Contextually, it fits perfectly with the theme of retreating to a cabin in the woods, specifically mentioning a cabin in the Colorado pines, which resonates with the user's daydream about a cabin in the woods. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story of finding solace and warmth in a secluded location, despite some minor grammatical inconsistencies that slightly affect the fluency."
"Practised for weeks, but the open-mic night was cancelled at the last minute—total letdown.",one night only is not enough,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's lyrics 'one night only is not enough' somewhat capture the disappointment of the user's situation, reflecting a desire for more opportunity, similar to the user's anticipation for the open-mic night. However, the lyrics are extremely brief and lack depth, making it difficult to fully align with the specific emotional and contextual nuances of the user's experience. The lyrics are coherent in themselves but do not provide enough context or detail to be fully relevant or emotionally resonant with the user's letdown from the cancelled event."
Can’t stand how people leave popcorn and cups all over the cinema floor after a movie; it really bothers me.,i m a big movie fan i m very very confused why so many people love the move scarface though i m not saying it s a bad movie it is but that s not my point it s just like that i ve seen tons of people in the past who wear like knee long scarface t shirts like it s a flag or something like the guy from scarface is their hero i wonder if they ve seen the end of the movie because it ends really really badly spoiler alert scarface dies snorting a comical pile of cocaine in a tacky ass mansion that looks like if the golden girls won the lottery cause they won the powerball lottery also i don t like people lumping in scarface with better movies i have friends that ll be like yeah i love movies that are like the godfather and scarface oh yeah well my favorite foods are lobster and skittles those are equal in my eyes i also think it s weird in moves when someone has amnesia and they wake up in the hospital a lot of times they ll be surrounded by friends and family but when they open their eyes they go who are you because that s not how you act when you don t recognize somebody that s very rude it would be chaos out there if every time you saw someone you didn t recognize you went who are you i always try to be really polite in life so like if i had amnesia you d never know it i d wake up and they d be like hi john we re so happy you re awake and i d just be like oh hey man how s it going oh hey dude nice to see you again because that s how you act when you can tell that someone recognizes you and you have no fucking clue who they are i love movies though i m kindait s funny to me over the summer when these big blockbuster action movies come out and you read about one movie one of these movies and it ll say that it cost something like 100 million dollars because whenever i read that i think like yeah you didn t need to make a movie with that money i would have bought a ticket just to see 100 million dollars like i am at a point in my life where i would wait on a line just to look at that much cash like you could just stack it up in a motel room and line us up down the hall you put some guy out front in a straw hat that s like it is 8 dollars to see the 100 million or 10 dollars to have your money added to the 100 million ooh very luxurious but think about it that would be entertaining you know you d go into this room and there d be like stacks of hundred dollar bills and jewelry and gold coins spilling out of a pirate chest because pirates never bring a big enough chest in pictures their gold coins are always overflowing and they can t get the lid closed why is that i think that maybe with the eye patches they have poor depth perception ,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The recommended song lyrics do not align with the user's emotional state of annoyance and frustration about the mess left in cinemas. The lyrics discuss various unrelated topics such as opinions on the movie 'Scarface', amnesia, and the cost of blockbuster movies, which do not connect to the user's concern about cleanliness and respect in public spaces. The lyrics are somewhat coherent as a stream of consciousness or comedic monologue but lack a clear, structured narrative, making them only slightly coherent in terms of lyrical fluency."
Stepped into the elevator and the stench of stale sweat hit me so hard it made my stomach flip.,i was running late for work so i didn t change my shirt the evening s drinks left a lingering taste in my mouth and when i left you were fast asleep tangled in the sheets and on the bus i could have sworn it was all a dream and it didn t happen to me and then i felt the scrapes from the slippery subway grate oh how you laughed at my complete lack of grace but i could not recall a more perfect fall cause when i looked up into your eyes it didn t hurt at all and i thought be still my heart this could be a brand new start with you and it will be clear if i wake up and you re still here with me in the morning and i thought be still my heart this could be a brand new start with you and it will be clear if i wake up and you re still here with me in the morning,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,"The song lyrics describe a morning after a possibly romantic encounter, focusing on feelings of surprise and contentment upon waking up. The emotional tone of the song, which is somewhat dreamy and hopeful, does not align well with the user's prompt of feeling repulsed by a bad smell in an elevator. Contextually, the song's setting and scenario (post-night-out, romantic implications) do not match the user's experience of a brief, unpleasant moment in an elevator. However, the lyrics themselves are quite coherent, telling a clear story with a consistent theme of a new romantic beginning. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional or contextual needs."
I called the new boss ‘mom’ during the video call and wanted to crawl under my desk.,when i m alone in my home sometimes i cover my face the walk around in circles at a slow pace it s my attempt to erase the feeling that i m standing in place at my 9 to 5 i teach computers to be clever so they can replace you and do the job better never say never corporate america is out to save cheddar computer programming ain t about creation it ain t about videogames or playstations it ain t about making new jobs or innovation it s about automation and permanent vacations just the other day my boss fires some cat that worked a thousand miles away there wasn t nothing i could say it was sad to see but i was glad it wasn t me 50 years of experience dependable one merger one meeting expendable i know it seems unbelievable they used to kiss your ass but now they don t need you you ever thought about when you ll be out of here nice job nice car still out of here middle management downsize then out of here some shit that i ain t tryin to hear fuck the job for real the best time in my career was at the start i was working extra hours pouring out my little heart now is hard for me to care when i know i m just a resource in somebody s chart staring at a corporate ladder i can t climb contributing to milestones and bullshit baselines ten hours a day wasting time trying to cut fat from my company s waistline i want y all to listen they spend 50k just to say 50 million they hire me to cut labor in divisions less for you less for your children you ever thought about when you ll be out of here nice job nice car still out of here middle management downsize then out of here some shit that i ain t tryin to hear fuck the job for real i ve seen a lot of people come and go seen a lot of people sit around complaining about doe i ve seen people get hired and then get a new car bragging and when it got tight i ve seen them brown bagging i ve seen people hire for jobs i wouldn t touch while being denied for jobs i really want i ve seen cats being promoted and demoted like chunks loose confidence then resign the next month i ve seen people close to tears because they got bad reviews walking to your cube and start interrogating you 20 questions arguing and bitching mad about the money you make in your position i ve seen women with kids stay in one spot i ve seen women without kids rise to the top seen them comming and buddy up with the managers then seen the same women move up the ladder i ve seen women stand still when they work twice as hard while men work half as hard and get twice as far ,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.67,"The recommended song primarily focuses on the frustrations and challenges of corporate life, automation, and job insecurity, which does not align well with the user's prompt about an embarrassing moment during a video call. Emotional alignment is low because the song's themes of job dissatisfaction and corporate criticism do not reflect the embarrassment and awkwardness described in the prompt. Contextually, the song mentions a work environment, which loosely connects to the user's situation of being in a work-related video call, but the content diverges significantly from the specific incident of mistakenly calling a boss 'mom'. Lyrical coherence is moderate as the lyrics are clear and tell a consistent story about workplace experiences, though they do not address the user's emotional or contextual needs effectively."

The emotional alignment is low as the song's tone is more about self-celebration and defiance rather than the pure excitement and anticipation described in the prompt. Contextually, the song does not specifically relate to attending an event or the feelings of anticipation for a finals game, but rather discusses personal achievements and challenges in the music industry. The lyrics are somewhat coherent with a clear narrative about the artist's journey and success, though they are repetitive and include slang and informal expressions that might detract from their overall clarity."
Walking past that abandoned lot at night makes my pulse race.,i m in a parking lot by myself it s quarter to nine and i ve been here since 5 45 there s no one but i can see some flickering lights i can hear some dogs barking in the back yards i smell gasoline i wish the sky were open cause if there weren t those trees i think i could see for miles the city is just beyond those clouds and i guess this is what it s like to be really down and holding out for something remembering the warm nights remembering the open arms of two years ago there s nothing like this parking lot and seeing the stars in morning i can see them from where i m lying i can feel the cold cold pavement on my skin and it s tingling,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics effectively capture the sense of isolation and unease that aligns well with the user's emotional state of a racing pulse when walking past an abandoned lot at night. The mention of being alone in a parking lot with flickering lights and barking dogs enhances the eerie atmosphere, matching the user's emotional experience. However, the context of the song being specifically about a parking lot and the personal reflections on past experiences slightly diverge from the specific scenario of an abandoned lot. The lyrics are coherent and paint a vivid picture of the scene and emotions, though they occasionally drift into more introspective thoughts that are less directly related to the immediate environment described in the user's prompt."
A stranger held the door while I juggled coffee and my laptop—brightened my morning.,i looked you up and down i liked everything i saw from the fragile outline of your hips to the trembling movements in your jaw but then the coffee cup shattered on the kitchen floor you said that you couldn t take it anymore i knew you were leaving i knew you were going to bristol i watched you pack your bags saw you head up to the door but when the key broke off in the deadbolt lock you said that you couldn t take it anymore that was the second time you said that in one day why don t you just sit still it s going to be ok going to bristol going to bristol going to bristol going to bristol,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's prompt emotionally or contextually. The user's prompt describes a small, positive interaction that brightened their morning, whereas the song lyrics focus on a distressing breakup and leaving, which conveys a negative and stressful emotion. Contextually, the song's theme of a relationship ending and moving away is unrelated to the simple act of kindness described in the prompt. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, telling a clear story, but they do not make complete sense in relation to the user's experience. Overall, the song does not match the uplifting and grateful tone of the user's prompt."
Scrolled past an old voicemail from her and suddenly the room felt empty.,the buzzing of the house has disappeared the glow is dimmed and contact s lost voices faces who were here the corner of the room was on and nothing else was needed no one else required nothing happens now it s all gone quiet for all intents for all our trust what was ever true the daily grind it sprang to life watching what was on instead of watching out the hours and hours and time to change i realise i m one of all the same but when i see you soon remind me how you lit up every room you knew that you were needed you talked and never tired how does it feel now that you ve been retired ,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of loss and emptiness, aligning well with the user's emotional state of feeling the room empty after encountering a reminder of a past relationship. The lyrics describe a quiet, dimmed environment, which matches the user's context of a sudden shift in atmosphere due to a memory. The coherence of the lyrics is somewhat fragmented, making it slightly challenging to follow a clear narrative, but the overall theme of reminiscence and loss is evident, supporting the emotional and contextual relevance."
My balcony tomatoes finally turned bright yellow today—couldn’t stop smiling.,and how i know i m happy now i jump right down the shoots of time and yes the weather was not always grey but the furrow always grazed my brow mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm now i m overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light yes we had some hard work but now it s right overcome with light overcome and my worries then were not grand but i felt them like a hammer pounding like i really feel feel them now and in a pinch i know i m dreaming mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm now i m overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light overcome with light yes we had some scrapes but now it s right overcome with light overcome overcome with light overcome with light overcome,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song's repeated motif of being 'overcome with light' aligns well with the user's emotion of joy and satisfaction from seeing their tomatoes turn bright yellow, reflecting a sense of achievement and happiness. This earns a high score in emotional alignment. However, the song's references to overcoming hardships and weather changes do not directly relate to the specific context of gardening or tomatoes, which lowers the score in contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive and abstract but maintain a consistent theme, which provides a moderate score in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song captures the mood of happiness but does not perfectly fit the gardening context."
He doodled a silly sketch of us on the fridge; totally melted my heart.,he came by in his funeral suit in an open hearted shade of blue asked me what i like to do on a july evening to bermondsey or to shoreditch i said i don t know which is which the night a thread for him to stitch for me the unbelieving in the end we just stay in and gesture with our mugs of gin dance around this borrowed kitchen a stop and start dumb show i am a cold filament we advance in tender increments between the past and future tense test the weight of both,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song captures a tender and intimate moment, aligning well with the emotional warmth and personal connection described in the user's prompt about a heartwarming sketch. However, the context of the song, which involves a more complex interaction possibly leading to a romantic evening, only partially matches the simple, sweet gesture of doodling mentioned in the prompt. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, presenting a narrative of a developing relationship, but they can be seen as abstract and slightly disjointed, which might make it harder for some listeners to fully grasp the storyline or connect it directly to the prompt."
Waiting outside the dentist’s room; my knee won’t stop bouncing.,bad blood saturating the sheets and the blankets good god there are ghosts floating up from the pavement they flip over the houses blood runs out from the basements in its unholy flow you remember this whimpering thick nauseous feeling from your step brother chasing you around with a staple gun when you were young it was fun and then suddenly pain became a very real thing do you remember that feeling similarly this isnt fiction well actually mostly it is or a series of irl moments cloaked in the vagueness that songs give but when theres nothing to say and youve got to say something fuck i dont even know we pass on the street and say hi cause we have to even though both of us are clearly just like i fucking hate you so stilted and silent not awkward just angry hey i gotta go but ill see you at the show its that song everybody loves but the are garbage and it stresses me out how often youre mentioned its like everyone we know collectively vomited up a pile of brown sweaters or something and were so impressed with the results that they put them on the wall and im so sad youre in my head and im so sorry its so venomous especially because weve got like maybe four or five words ever spoken between us but i cant heave my heart into my mouth i cant tell you i cant stop you i dont want to this first day of school shit just seems to keep happening everybody says man its so cool were so glad youre doing your own thing but worse than disdain is colossal indifference the smiles are so big and theres no one at the gig im either deep in the woods or on tv for everyone and i know its disgusting how much i think about myself in relation to nothing the things that arent gonna stay just arent gonna stay like i was getting a tooth pulled in the free clinic in portland in 2007 the dentist turned out to be this dude a drummer whose band id recorded and somehow that was comforting then the novocaine block kicked in it closed up my throat and i was ready to go home maybe once this record comes out then i can stop drinking that might look good on a press release or something if they even still do those wait im certain they still do those and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes and then the summer comes and then the fall comes and then the winter comes and then the spring comes,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The song lyrics chosen have a very minimal connection to the user's prompt of waiting outside the dentist's room with a sense of nervous anticipation. The emotional alignment is low as the song's overall tone is more chaotic and filled with anger and frustration, which does not align well with the simple anxiety of waiting for a dental appointment. Contextually, there is a brief mention of a dental experience, but it is not the main focus of the song and does not significantly relate to the user's current situation. The lyrical coherence is slightly better, as the lyrics, while disjointed and stream-of-consciousness, do convey a clear sense of emotional turmoil and personal reflection. However, the overall relevance and alignment with the user's emotional and contextual needs are low."
"Got a rejection email, yet somehow I feel the next interview will click.",checked my phone for the hundredth time today i guess i m hoping that i ll see your name with a message saying everything s okay a message saying that i m not your next mistake why d you leave i can t perceive a logical explanation why d you leave can t you see that you belong with me ,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.5,"The recommended song lyrics primarily focus on feelings of longing and confusion over someone's departure, which does not align well with the user's emotional state of being rejected but hopeful. The emotional alignment is low because the song conveys a sense of loss and lack of understanding, contrasting with the user's optimistic outlook about future opportunities. Contextually, the song also misses the mark as it seems to deal with personal relationships rather than professional or interview contexts. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent, maintaining a clear theme of questioning and emotional pain, which earns a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
Ran my first 5 k without stopping; pretty pleased with myself.,tried to call you n got the answer phone now i m glad i m free to spend a weekend on my own do the shopping jog in the park and there s a lot of housework that needs to be done i m turning myself into a superhero of sorts and i m so happy now you didn t take my call this morning,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song's emotional tone partially aligns with the user's feeling of self-satisfaction and independence, as it mentions activities like jogging and doing housework alone, which can be seen as forms of self-care and personal achievement. However, the context of the song, which seems to revolve around a breakup or a desire for solitude after a failed attempt to connect with someone, doesn't perfectly match the user's context of celebrating a personal fitness milestone. The lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack fluency, affecting the overall coherence and making it harder to fully grasp or relate to the intended message."
"Realised the meeting invite said 7 a.m., not p.m.—no wonder no one joined.",not submitted,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Since no song lyrics were provided, it is impossible to evaluate the emotional alignment, contextual relevance, or lyrical coherence in relation to the user's prompt. Therefore, all scores are zero."
The lights flicked back on as soon as the storm ended—felt like exhaling.,the sun went down and the ground started sort of grinding a blinding light tore across the sky a cyclone swept the landscape out and left it completely flattened out and several twirls of smoke unfolded like gigantic flowers the way the morning broke was quite unusual i should have wakened up at once but this was no concern of mine so i kept on dreaming my eyes roamed over the burning ruins in less time than it takes to tell and i felt like and i felt like being numbed i felt like mesmerized the way the morning broke was quite unusual more than words can say in less time than it takes to tell,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song captures a sense of aftermath and recovery, somewhat aligning with the emotion of relief and renewal after a storm as described in the user's prompt. However, the song's focus on destruction and a somewhat apocalyptic tone diverges from the lighter, more hopeful feeling of the prompt where the lights flicking back on symbolize a return to normalcy and safety. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and abstract, making it difficult to follow a coherent narrative or fully grasp the intended emotion, which affects the lyrical coherence score. Overall, while there are elements of emotional and contextual alignment, the mismatch in tone and the lyrical complexity reduce the overall fit."
"Snapped at my sister for no reason earlier, and it’s eating at me now.",i ain t got no big coat on i ain t got no sharp claws i have no damn whiskers to keep track of you you got claws you got sharp teeth for ripping slack off while you roll your eyes as he picks you dry it s your life you ll defend him with your life wasted on a lion waiting for dead meat life wasted on a lion waiting for dead meat sister beware,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
Boxed up the holiday decorations; the living room looks strangely empty.,christmas time is here again it don t seem so different when last year which was filled with emptiness all around directionless,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a sense of emptiness and a lack of direction, which aligns well with the user's emotional state after removing holiday decorations, leaving the living room feeling empty. The mention of 'Christmas time' directly connects to the context of packing up holiday decorations. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, though they could flow better and provide a clearer narrative structure. Overall, the song matches well with the user's emotional and contextual prompt."
Opened the fridge and found a note that read ‘road trip tomorrow!’—didn’t see that coming.,made a note of it did you write it on your hand put a name on it to help you understand well do you see the future s holidays are for me just let me know where we go after the fall like the sound of it gonna hang it on your wall turn and run with it for the sake of one and all where you go nobody knows well do you see the future s holidays are for me just let me know where to go where you go after the fall2,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song captures the surprise and spontaneity associated with the unexpected announcement of a road trip, aligning well with the emotional tone of the prompt (score: 4). The lyrics suggest a sense of adventure and sudden plans, which fits the theme of an unplanned journey, though it's not specifically about a road trip (score: 3). However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat lacking; the lyrics are a bit disjointed and cryptic, making it difficult to fully grasp a clear narrative or message (score: 2). Overall, the song moderately suits the user's prompt with a decent emotional and contextual match but is pulled down by its lyrical clarity."
Watching my sister patiently guide my nephew through his first steps left me amazed by her dedication.,i m watchin sis go pitterpat said i can do that i can do that knew ev ry step right off the bat said i can do that i can do that one morning sis won t go to dance class i grab her shoes and tights and all but my foot s too small so i stuff her shoes with extra socks run seven blocks in nothin flat hell i can do that i can do that i got to class and had it made and so i stayed the rest of my life all thanks to sis i can do this that i can do i can do that ,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of admiration and inspiration, similar to the user's feelings of amazement at their sister's dedication. This aligns well emotionally, scoring a 4. Contextually, the song involves a sibling relationship and a learning or growing experience, which somewhat matches the user's situation of watching a sister teach, scoring a 3. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat low, scoring a 2, due to the disjointed and somewhat confusing narrative flow and grammar, which might make it harder for the user to fully connect with the song's message."
I just finished a comedy movie and found myself laughing out loud through the entire end credits.,the room was filled with talk for anyone listening i found a spot by the door with no one around let my mind go out of tune out of tune i kept a smile on my face for anyone looking tried to turn away questions before being asked let my mind go out of tune out of tune i was engrossed in the film without really watching said who s the guy with the gun as if i was involved let my mind go out of tune out of tune out of tune out of tune out of tune2,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.33,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of joy and amusement after watching a comedy movie. The lyrics suggest a sense of detachment and disengagement ('let my mind go out of tune', 'without really watching'), which contrasts with the user's experience of active enjoyment and laughter. Contextually, the song's theme of disconnection does not match the lively and humorous atmosphere of a comedy movie ending. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but repetitive, lacking a clear progression or narrative that might resonate more effectively with the user's recent experience."
"I just returned to my desk and found my meticulously organized files shredded and scattered everywhere, and I was absolutely furious.",i packed all my things in a nylon bag i kept my eyes open wide and got out the day the stock went black what was so alluring has now faded and just stylistic and jaded but i m just glad to get out of there for metal school if i could take back what we both assumed would you spin it back to me on the lazy sue it could exist to be where we found it and we d just wrap our fingers around it that s why i m going to give it all up put all that back and enroll in metal school,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The song lyrics do not align well with the user's emotional state of fury, as they primarily discuss a personal decision to leave a situation and start anew, which might suggest a sense of relief or escape rather than anger. Contextually, the song does not match the scenario of dealing with a destructive act at a workplace or personal space, as it talks about a personal transformation unrelated to the user's experience of having their organized files destroyed. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but can be confusing with references to 'metal school' and 'lazy sue,' which do not clearly connect to the narrative or emotion intended by the user."
The neighbor's car alarm blaring at sunrise grated on my nerves and ruined my morning.,i had to wake up my head first my body had a few more minutes and my throat was dying of thirst of course i should have known the morning would be this way but there was no use ignoring the rest of the day since people are dying in almost every possible place i d rather not leave the bed here with you since there s a dead black cat scattered on my street i d rather stay here under the sheets there was a parade outside the window with no cars just dead cats being pulled by horses with blinds over their eyes i m sure we could see ourselves rolling in the cats when the carts moved back and forth hitting the holes in the street,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,"The recommended song does not align well with the user's emotional state of irritation and frustration caused by a car alarm. The song's theme of staying in bed and avoiding the outside world, while somewhat relevant to wanting to escape an annoyance, does not specifically address the context of a disturbing noise early in the morning. Additionally, the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and surreal, discussing dead cats and parades, which does not coherently match the user's straightforward scenario of a disrupted morning. Overall, the song fails to provide a therapeutic or relevant response to the user's situation."
"After staying up all night finishing that report, hearing my manager praise my work in the morning convinced me i’d made the right call.",listen to the sound listen to the sound everything always works out,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics reflect a positive and reassuring tone, aligning well with the emotion of relief and validation the user felt after receiving praise from their manager. This scores high in emotional alignment. Contextually, the lyrics are somewhat relevant as they suggest a general sense of things working out, which mirrors the user's experience of their effort paying off. However, the lyrics are quite repetitive and lack depth, which affects their contextual relevance and lyrical coherence. The simplicity and repetitiveness of the lyrics might not fully capture the complexity of the user's feelings and the specific scenario of working hard on a report all night."
"My brother felt terrible all night, so I stayed by his side and made sure he had everything he needed.",oh brother brother brother i know you ve been laying back a long time but i love you like no other oh brother brother brother i ve been watching everything you do and i ve been wishing only good for you all you ve got to do is just want it to and it s gonna come to you you have always been so good to me and though you didn t always talk to me there wasn t much my loving eyes could not see and i don t believe you need all your misery ,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.3,"The song's lyrics strongly align with the emotional tone of the user's prompt, which is centered around care and support for a brother. The repeated mentions of 'brother' and expressions of love and concern reflect the user's feelings and actions of staying by their brother's side. The context of the song, focusing on familial support and overcoming struggles, matches the user's situation of caring for a sibling in distress. The lyrics are coherent and fluently express a narrative of love, support, and hope for betterment, which resonates well with the user's experience. The overall score reflects a high degree of emotional and contextual relevance, along with lyrical coherence."
Receiving an urgent call from my doctor asking me to come in immediately without any details left me completely uncertain about what was wrong.,the doctor came in the morning she held my hand and asked was it worth it could it be worse than this please recall give me a hint anything will do if this was the last time now you should tell us what to do i was afraid i guess now i can t think no more i was so concentrated on keeping things together i ve learned to focus on i didn t want to disappoint now where is everybody is it still light outside 1,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song captures the emotional state of uncertainty and fear quite well, aligning with the user's feelings of anxiety after receiving an urgent, ambiguous call from the doctor. The lyrics express confusion, a need for answers, and a sense of urgency, which resonates with the user's situation. Contextually, the song is relevant as it involves a doctor and a sense of medical urgency, though it doesn't specifically address the scenario of being called in without details, focusing more on an ongoing interaction. The lyrics are coherent and convey a clear narrative of someone grappling with a serious, unclear situation, though some lines could be seen as slightly disjointed or abstract, affecting the overall clarity."
I just uncovered a major secret hidden in the archives and can’t stop wondering what else I’ll find.,well i was ready to walk into your heart i ll make believe there s something i ve lost but i think you know what i ve done oh i think you know i ll be your surprise it s just a secret that s alwasy on display or just a memory you can t throw away oh i ll be your surprise,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,"The song partially aligns with the emotional aspect of the prompt, capturing a sense of discovery and secrecy with phrases like 'I think you know what I've done' and 'it's just a secret that's always on display.' However, it lacks a direct connection to the excitement or curiosity about uncovering historical or significant secrets, focusing more on personal secrets in a relationship. Contextually, the song's theme of personal secrets and surprises does not strongly relate to the idea of uncovering historical or significant archives. The lyrics themselves are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative, making it difficult to fully grasp the storyline or the connection between the thoughts expressed, which impacts the lyrical coherence."

The user expresses a desire to try cooking a chocolate soufflé, indicating a mood of excitement and curiosity about culinary activities. However, the song's lyrics focus on themes of wild love, personal relationships, and seduction, which are unrelated to cooking or the specific culinary task mentioned. The emotional tone of the song is more about boldness and intimacy rather than the calm, focused joy of cooking. Contextually, the song does not mention cooking, baking, or any related activities, making it irrelevant to the user's interest in making a chocolate soufflé. The lyrical coherence is low as the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, lacking a clear narrative or fluency that would enhance understanding or enjoyment."
"I opened the email to see that tonight’s concert had been canceled, leaving me utterly let down.",i dropped my book and saw a face her hair red my feelings cold i just can t feel anything anymore funerals are for the living but i can t quite die i really want to go but i will miss music like this and i would forever wonder if everything would turn out okay in the end come on we all die in the end but at times i want to die in the middle but now now i think it s the end,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
"I just found out the community center canceled the free cooking classes without telling me, and it felt unfair that they didn’t ask for my opinion.",i went to class you didn t show up i thought we said that we d keep in touch walk through town disassembled on a crutch just like we did when you were in love i left the house and i didn t miss much you opened your mouth and i lost my trust yeah i left the house for the first time in months for the first time in months now here i am disassembled as a whole when i got home i lost control,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"The song captures a sense of disappointment and betrayal, which aligns somewhat with the user's feelings of unfairness and being disregarded. However, the song's primary focus on personal relationships and emotional breakdown doesn't perfectly match the specific context of a canceled community event. The lyrics are fluent and convey a clear narrative of disillusionment and loss of trust, which makes them relatively coherent. Overall, the song moderately addresses the user's emotional state but lacks direct relevance to the specific situation of canceled classes."
"I just took a bite of my sandwich and realized it had gone bad, making my stomach turn.",i burnt the roof of my mouth on some pizza that was not even good i know that i should have waited for the cheese to cool down but i was hungry because i forgot to eat breakfast,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,"The song lyrics and the user's prompt both share a theme of food-related discomfort, which provides some contextual relevance. However, the emotional alignment is slightly off as the song describes a minor, somewhat humorous inconvenience of burning one's mouth, whereas the user's experience with spoiled food might evoke a stronger sense of disgust or upset. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear, if simple, story about impatience and its minor consequences. Overall, the song moderately matches the user's situation but does not fully capture the emotional depth of the experience."
I just waved enthusiastically at someone who wasn’t waving at me and wanted to disappear on the spot.,guess i m just a gust of wind moved on quickly almost unnoticed but quite powerful our rush could easily have blown your defenses down could easily have blown your defenses down did you hear me whispering hello did you see me waving goodbye did you notice that i didn t cry i guess i just brushed through your mind more gently than i intended to not fresh enough just a breeze i can make you fly high i can make you fly high did you hear me whispering hello did you see me waving goodbye did you notice that i didn t cry your taste i don t mind it was worth the try and though uninvited i came by did you notice that i didn t cry,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song captures the emotion of embarrassment and the desire to be unnoticed, aligning well with the user's feeling of wanting to disappear after an awkward social interaction. The metaphor of being a 'gust of wind' that goes unnoticed, yet has a presence, resonates with the user's experience. Contextually, the song's theme of fleeting interactions and unnoticed presence is relevant, though it extends beyond the specific moment of waving to broader themes of emotional presence and absence, which slightly dilutes the direct contextual relevance. The lyrics are coherent and poetic, maintaining a consistent metaphor and emotional tone throughout, which aids in conveying the song's message effectively."
I just found out my best friend is flying in for a surprise visit and I can’t stop smiling.,i wanted to come visit you waiting in the spring time when the leaves change the ground outside is begging for the newness that surrounds us as we dance back through the screen door in the sunlight of mid april but the glow won t stop the smiles that are spreading on our faces as we fall down on the kitchen floor and she s laughing about something that she had heard earlier and i can t help noticing that she is sitting closer to me than she ever has before ,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,"The song perfectly captures the emotion of joy and excitement that comes with reuniting with a loved one, aligning well with the user's feelings of happiness about their friend's surprise visit. The context of the song, which describes a joyful reunion in spring, is quite relevant, though not a direct match since it doesn't specifically mention a surprise visit. The lyrics are somewhat poetic and free-flowing, which might make them slightly less coherent on a first read, but they still effectively convey the joy and closeness of the interaction."
"I just got word my friend is driving here through this raging thunderstorm, and each crack of thunder sent a chill down my spine.",we are in the storm ,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,"The recommended song lyrics 'we are in the storm' somewhat align with the emotional state of the user, reflecting the anxiety and tension caused by the thunderstorm. However, the lyrics are extremely brief and lack detail, which limits their ability to fully capture the depth of the user's concern for their friend's safety. Contextually, the mention of a storm directly relates to the user's situation, but the simplicity and lack of further context or development in the lyrics reduce their impact. The lyrical coherence is low due to the minimal content provided, making it difficult to assess the fluency or the complete narrative of the song."
"I came home after a long day to find my partner had cleaned up and cooked dinner, and it made me realize how lucky I am to have them.",i done run into my baby and finally found my old blue jeans well i done ran into my baby and finally found my old blue jeans i knew they was mine by the oil and the gasoline yeah if i ever get back my blue jeans well how happy could one man be i said uh if i ever get back my blue jeans well how happy can one man be cause when i get back those blue jeans yeah you know my baby will bring em home to me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,"The recommended song primarily discusses the joy of finding a pair of old blue jeans, which is a metaphor for rediscovering something valuable. However, the emotional alignment with the user's prompt is low, as the song's focus on material recovery (jeans) does not effectively capture the deep emotional gratitude and love expressed in the user's situation of being cared for by their partner. Contextually, the song is also not relevant as it does not address the themes of domestic partnership or the acts of service that are central to the user's experience. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent with a clear, albeit repetitive, narrative about the jeans, but they do not provide a meaningful connection to the user's emotional state or context."
"I just found my grandmother’s favorite shawl tucked in her chair, and tears welled up as I remembered her warmth.",i walked through the door with you the air was cold but something bout it felt like home somehow and i left my scarf there at your sister s house and you ve still got it in your drawer even now oh your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze we re singing in the car getting lost upstate autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place and i can picture it after all these days and i know it s long gone and that magic s not here no more and i might be okay but i m not fine at all oh oh oh cause there we are again on that little town street you almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me wind in my hair i was there i remember it all too well photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed and your mother s telling stories bout you on the tee ball team you taught me bout your past thinking your future was me and i know it s long gone and there was nothing else i could do and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to cause there we are again in the middle of the night we re dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light down the stairs i was there i remember it all too well yeah  well maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much but maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up running scared i was there i remember it all too well and you call me up again just to break me like a promise so casually cruel in the name of being honest i m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here cause i remember it all all all too well time won t fly it s like i m paralyzed by it i d like to be my old self again but i m still trying to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now you mail back my things and i walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from that very first week cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me you can t get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah cause there we are again when i loved you so back before you lost the one real thing you ve ever known it was rare i was there i remember it all too well wind in my hair you were there you remember it all down the stairs you were there you remember it all it was rare i was there i remember it all too well146,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"The recommended song lyrically captures a sense of nostalgia and emotional reflection, aligning somewhat with the user's emotional state of remembering a loved one. However, the context of the song, which revolves around a romantic relationship and its memories, does not perfectly align with the user's context of familial love and remembrance. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear story, though they focus more on a past romantic relationship rather than a familial bond. Overall, the song partially matches the emotional tone but diverges in context, making it a moderate fit for the user's prompt."
"I opened my inbox this morning to find I’d received my scholarship award, and I can’t stop grinning from ear to ear.",this morning i picked up a paper i read about tragedy i stopped and i realized that it could ve of been me that could ve been my mother or even my big brother but you kept them just like you kept me i want to tell you that god has smiled on me he has set me free god has smiled on he has been good to me now i ve been through some things that i thought were unnecessary were way too much to carry all by myself but you gave me strength to make it through i thought i couldn t take it feels so good to know that you care yeah yeah yeah god  god has smiled on me he has set me free god has smiled on he has been good to me so glad i know you glad you re my friend whenever i need you you re always near you don t have to be so good to me but you keep on smiling god has smiled on me he has set me free god has smiled on he has been good to me,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,"The song's emotional tone of gratitude and relief partially aligns with the user's joy and gratitude for receiving a scholarship, scoring a 2 for emotional alignment. However, the song's context primarily revolves around overcoming tragedy and hardships, which doesn't align well with the celebratory nature of receiving a scholarship, thus scoring a 1 for contextual relevance. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, maintaining a consistent theme of gratitude towards divine intervention, scoring a 3 for lyrical coherence. Overall, the song does not match well with the specific context of celebrating a scholarship award, resulting in a lower overall score."

The lyrics express a deep appreciation and comfort in the presence of a loved one, resonating with the heartwarming surprise in the user's prompt. Contextually, the song focuses more on not wanting mornings to come and staying in bed with a loved one, which slightly deviates from the specific scenario of receiving flowers but still fits the theme of romantic gestures. The lyrics are generally coherent and fluently express the emotions of love and contentment, though they are somewhat repetitive which might affect the clarity of the narrative."

I just watched the sunrise break through the clouds and felt sure today would bring new opportunities.,the sky was bright with light the moon opened my eyes to love the sun breaks through the night gives meaning to our lives for now it s all we have to give,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song lyrics align well emotionally with the user's experience of watching the sunrise and feeling hopeful about new opportunities. The mention of the sun breaking through and giving meaning aligns with the sense of renewal and positivity. Contextually, the lyrics fit the theme of a sunrise and a new beginning, though they introduce broader themes of love and existential meaning which slightly diverge from the specific context of the user's prompt. The lyrical coherence is moderate; the lyrics are somewhat poetic and evocative but could be clearer in their narrative or thematic progression, making them slightly less impactful in terms of fluency and direct sense."

The lyrics, which satirize corporate culture and materialism, contrast sharply with the genuine joy and satisfaction described in the user's prompt. Contextually, the song does touch on corporate themes, but in a cynical and critical way, which does not match the positive context of the user's achievement. The lyrical coherence is low as the lyrics are disjointed and filled with corporate jargon that seems to mock rather than celebrate corporate achievements. Overall, the song does not effectively match the user's emotional state or the context of their accomplishment."
"I just found an old photo of my childhood home tucked away in a drawer, and it made me realize how far I’ve come.",i climbed the hill to julie s house the place i used to live i climbed the steps and tried the door and let myself in the kitchen clock i used to watch had stopped at five to five a photograph i d never seen a car came up the drive i stood outside the kitchen door and when she turned her head i said that i was back to stay she laughed at what i said she said that i d grow old believing that i was what mattered most that i d uncover real feelings as i got close i climbed the hill to julie s house the place i used to live i climbed the steps and tried the door and let myself in she said that i d grow old believing that i was what mattered most that i d uncover real feelings as i got close,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a nostalgic journey similar to the user's experience of finding an old photo and reminiscing about their past. The emotional alignment is strong as the song captures the essence of revisiting a place from the past and the emotions tied to it, scoring a 4. The contextual relevance is also high, scoring a 4, because the song directly deals with returning to a former home, mirroring the user's reflection on their childhood home. However, the lyrical coherence scores a 3 as the lyrics, while evocative, are somewhat repetitive and could benefit from greater variety to enhance the narrative depth. Overall, the song matches well with the user's emotional and contextual prompt but could be improved in lyrical execution."

This gives the song a high score in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song touches on themes of struggle and resilience which are relevant to the user's situation of dealing with stressful test results, though the song's broader focus on continuous life challenges makes it slightly less specific to the user's immediate context of receiving a specific piece of good news. The lyrical coherence of the song is somewhat lower due to the repetitive and somewhat disjointed phrases, making it harder to follow a clear narrative or message throughout the song."
I just reread the harsh message I sent my friend last night and felt a deep regret for how I spoke.,today i got a letter from someone just a friend we knew some time ago and as i read between the lines i began to realize he didn t know i lost you a long long time ago oh i just can t make it any longer everything i do is always wrong i m living a lie and there s no need in trying to keep hanging on after all the good is gone lord i wish that i could die and there s no use in trying to keep hanging on after all the good is gone,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.
"I just sat down for dinner and saw my father’s chair still empty, my heart ached and I can’t stop crying.",my old man died on a saturday night i watched as he just stopped breathing and though it was awful and painful and sad i was glad that he wasn t alone it felt like something he d just had to go through an arduous task he d been given and it seemed so unfair it was his cross to bear the sickest and weakest of us oh we never spoke much as a father and son but we had an understanding and i still hear his voice when i open my mouth in anger or wisdom or such or if i see a similar jacket or hair i think for a moment i ve found him but then i remember it s not about where and i know he s not lost he is gone i m just glad that he wasn t alone,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song's lyrics deeply resonate with the emotional state described in the user's prompt, reflecting the pain and sorrow of losing a father, which aligns perfectly with the user's experience of missing their father at the dinner table. The context of loss and remembrance in the song matches the user's situation, making it highly relevant. The lyrics are coherent and tell a clear narrative about the relationship and feelings towards the father, though some abstract phrases might slightly obscure the message for some listeners.

However, the song's darker themes of conflict and hoping the brother 'is right in the head' diverge significantly from the user's hopeful and aspirational sentiment. Contextually, the song does touch on the theme of brotherhood but in a more conflicted and less aspirational manner than the user's prompt. The lyrics themselves are somewhat coherent but can be confusing and disjointed, discussing ghosts, guardian angels, and violence, which detracts from a clear narrative or message."

of feeling light and entertained, as it contains themes of stress, fatigue, and various challenging experiences during a music tour. The context of the song, which revolves around the difficulties and realities of touring and performing, does not match the user's experience of a joyful and amusing concert. The lyrics, while detailed and narrative in style, are somewhat rambling and lack coherence in delivering a clear, focused message, which further detracts from its suitability for the user's described mood and context."
I’m honestly so mad right now. I trusted someone again and they hurt me—how can people keep doing this?,there are people who i trust there are people who trust me and i don t know why they re choosing to confide in someone who will talk about anything there are people who i miss there are people who miss me and i don t know why they re investing all their time into someone with my history so now i m numb and it s because of everything my eyes are tired my body s tired of waking up and still being me,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of betrayal and disappointment in oneself and others, which aligns well with the user's feelings of anger and hurt due to broken trust. The emotional alignment is high as the lyrics express a similar frustration and confusion about why people confide in or miss the speaker despite their past, mirroring the user's bewilderment at being hurt again. Contextually, the song fits as it discusses trust issues and emotional exhaustion, which resonates with the user's situation. The lyrical coherence is slightly lower because, while the lyrics are expressive and thematic, they can be somewhat repetitive and vague, lacking a clear narrative or progression, which might make them less impactful in conveying a complete story or resolution."
"There’s this person I deal with regularly, and the way he speaks just really irritates me. I don’t know why it gets to me so much.",i m bothered by the way you try to walk away when i need to talk to you it s not what you say it s what you do just like you don t even care it s all those little things whoa that get to me won t let them get to me whoa get to me right now we ve got to stop and little simple talk judging by my evil face is our friendship that meaningless to you i m not asking you to stay ,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of frustration and irritation, aligning well with the user's emotional state of being bothered by someone's manner of speaking. This scores a 4 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the song addresses interpersonal communication issues, which is relevant to the user's situation of dealing with someone irritating, scoring a 3. The lyrics, while expressive, are somewhat disjointed and repetitive, affecting the fluency and overall coherence, thus scoring a 3. The overall score averages to 3.3, indicating a moderate match to the user's prompt."
Someone at work has been handling things incredibly well. I just wanted to say I genuinely respect how he manages everything.,no matter what the problem may be he s in control and he knows everything i have the victory for he is my king in him i live move and i have my being let the people lift him up rejoice and shout unto him for you have caused us to triumph and we know we will rule in the end lift him up lift him up lift him up higher and higher higher higher higher higher and higher ,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,"The song lyrics score high on emotional alignment as they convey a strong sense of admiration and respect towards someone who is in control and victorious, which aligns well with the user's sentiment of respect for a colleague's management skills. However, the contextual relevance is moderate because the song seems to be more focused on spiritual or religious victory and praise, which might not directly relate to a workplace context. The lyrical coherence is average; the lyrics are somewhat repetitive and primarily focused on praising and lifting someone up, which might not fully capture the specific nuances of workplace admiration but still maintains a general sense of coherence."
"I’ve been taking care of a little bunny for a couple of years, and I feel so responsible for his well-being. He means a lot to me.",you know that i care what happens to you and i know that you care for me so i don t feel alone or the weight of the stone now that i ve found somewhere safe to bury my bone and any fool knows a dog needs a home a shelter from pigs on the wing,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a sense of care and responsibility, aligning somewhat with the user's emotional state regarding their attachment and responsibility towards their bunny. However, the song's reference to a 'dog' and 'pigs on the wing' slightly misaligns with the specific context of caring for a bunny, thus lowering the contextual relevance score. The lyrics are coherent and flow well, but the metaphorical language might not directly resonate with the user's situation, impacting the overall effectiveness of the song as a therapeutic match."
I just got here and I feel completely disoriented. I don’t understand what’s going on or what I’m supposed to be doing.,i don t know who you think you are i don t know what you re doing here i don t know what s going on here i don t know how it s supposed to be i i don t have the vaguest notion whose it is what it s all for i don t know i m not crying laughin mostly as you can see,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song's lyrics strongly reflect the user's feelings of disorientation and confusion, scoring high in emotional alignment. The repeated phrases 'I don't know' resonate with the user's expressed uncertainty about their situation. Contextually, the song fits reasonably well as it deals with a sense of not understanding one's surroundings or purpose, which aligns with the user's feelings of being lost upon arrival in a new situation. However, the song's lyrical coherence is somewhat lower; the lyrics are somewhat disjointed and lack a clear narrative or flow, which might make it harder for the user to find a solid grounding or comfort in the message. Overall, the song does a good job of mirroring the user's emotional state but could be more effective if the lyrics were more structured and coherent."

The context of exploration and curiosity is also well-matched, making the song relevant to the user's described feelings. However, the lyrical coherence is somewhat lower due to repetitive phrases and a somewhat disjointed flow, which might make it harder for the user to fully connect with the song on a deeper level. Overall, the song is a good match for the user's emotional and contextual needs but could be improved in terms of lyrical clarity and structure."
"More than anything right now, I just want to grow and improve. I want to become someone I can be proud of.",well i wish that i could be someone else sometimes i understand that i m not supposed to feel like this i should be happy inside i m trying honest i am look how busy i am but i might not learn how to fix it or even change it well i might try opening up sometimes i can be angry inside i m fine i ll do it myself like i ve done it before and i won t need anyone s help i mean anyone s help but i might not learn how to fix it or even change it but i might not learn how to fix it or even change it ,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics reflect a struggle with self-improvement and personal growth, aligning well with the user's emotional state of wanting to grow and improve. This scores a 4 in emotional alignment. The context of self-improvement is present, though the song focuses more on internal struggles and frustrations rather than a proactive desire to change, leading to a score of 3 in contextual relevance. The lyrics, however, are somewhat repetitive and lack a clear structure, making them less coherent and fluent, resulting in a score of 2 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song moderately suits the user's needs but could be improved in coherence and positivity towards growth."
"I thought I could rely on someone close to me, but they let me down again. It hurts more than I expected.",when she sat me down just to tell me i m alone again the only thing i thought was that i don t need any friends cause they re all living in my head and things will never be the same but i don t think i d have it any other way and my thoughts haven t really changed the only thing i can t figure out is who s to blame for all my selfish deeds undone i guess that i m the only one who knows that in the end i didn t try hard enough i can t wait to die alone,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of betrayal and loneliness, aligning well with the user's emotional state of feeling let down by someone close. The theme of isolation and self-blame in the lyrics resonates with the user's hurt, scoring high on emotional alignment. Contextually, the song fits as it discusses the aftermath of trust issues and personal disappointment, though it veers slightly into self-blame rather than focusing solely on the betrayal by another, which slightly lowers its contextual relevance score. The lyrics are somewhat coherent, expressing a clear narrative of emotional turmoil and introspection, though the flow and clarity could be improved for better understanding."
"I tried to accept things the way they are, but I can’t anymore. I don’t agree with what’s happening, and I think I need to walk away.",i cant see through this transparency but i guess ive been wrong about everything so should i lie or dumb myself down to feel okay or do i phone it in awhile until the feeling goes away im on the outside looking in and i dont see you again you know exactly where ive been becoming self aware becoming self aware im thinking i half believe that i dont care anymore walking like an old man but feeling immature weve learned we wont agree on anything the line drawn in the sand rethinking where im standing now and if ill ever stand a chance i know i know i could call this home but i dont want to make this awkward i wont i know i could call this home but i dont want to make this awkward anymore,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of disillusionment and the struggle with acceptance, aligning well with the user's emotional state of not being able to accept things as they are and considering walking away. This scores a 4 in emotional alignment. Contextually, the lyrics delve into the theme of internal conflict and the decision to possibly leave a situation, which matches the user's context of needing to walk away, scoring a 4. The lyrical coherence is somewhat fragmented and abstract, making it slightly challenging to follow a clear narrative or consistent thought process, thus scoring a 3. Overall, the song resonates well with the user's feelings and situation but could be clearer in its lyrical presentation."

The user expresses excitement and anticipation about receiving a new air fryer, which is a positive and eager emotion. However, the song lyrics about a new refrigerator and a somewhat menacing tone ('I'm gonna get you tonight') do not match the user's joyful anticipation. The song's focus on a refrigerator, although related to kitchen appliances, is not directly relevant to an air fryer. The lyrics themselves are somewhat repetitive and lack depth, which affects their coherence. Overall, the song does not effectively capture the user's current emotional state or the specific context of awaiting a new air fryer."
"I had a terrifying moment recently—my whole body froze, and I felt like something horrible was about to happen.",i haven t felt this way in a long time and it scares me what are these voices that tell me that i m ugly and fake and i think they might be right i m nothing and i have no heart it s quite possibly i have no soul drugs can t help me anymore and i think i m dying we re both dying really but sooner than others i think my time is now and i burned the bodies to the ground i saw faces turned to ash and i remember these faces baby because it s the last thing you ll ever see too bad it s not as good looking as you like i m already dead and i think i ll take you i ll take you with me,,,,,The song was filtered out by the content filter.

The mention of being 'grateful' and recognizing interconnectedness with 'everything' mirrors the user's feelings of gratitude towards life and relationships. Contextually, the song fits well with the theme of reflection and appreciation. The lyrics are fluent and make sense, though they could benefit from slightly more detail or depth to enhance coherence. Overall, the song is a strong match for the user's emotional and contextual needs."
"Someone very important to me is gone, and no matter how much time passes, I still feel the weight of that loss.",i ve been so long without you i try not to think about you but i do i know that i m to blame i got no right to call your name but i do i do i m so hurt to think that you d lie to me i m hurt way down deep inside of me,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,"The song lyrics reflect a strong sense of loss and longing, aligning well with the user's emotional state of missing someone important who is no longer present. The emotional intensity of feeling 'hurt' and the repeated admissions of missing the person ('but I do') resonate with the user's description of the persistent weight of their loss. However, the song also introduces elements of blame and deceit ('to think that you'd lie to me'), which might not perfectly align with the user's context if their loss was not under similar circumstances, slightly reducing its contextual relevance. The lyrics are coherent and express a clear narrative of emotional pain and longing, making them easy to understand and relate to."

I can't believe this is my life,i used to be a fool and think that life was cruel and full of hate but now i see things are not so bad if only i had had someone to hold my hand like you i d do it then i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now and now that i am free from all that misery and i can smile again cause you came into my life said you d be my wife and made me realize that life is wonderful and i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now i m so happy now you changed my life somehow i m so happy now,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"The song's lyrics strongly align with the emotion of happiness expressed in the user's prompt, reflecting a significant positive change in the singer's life, similar to the user's experience. The context of a life-changing happiness due to a significant other is somewhat relevant to the user's prompt about an unspecified cause of happiness, hence the slightly lower score in contextual relevance. The lyrics, while repetitive and somewhat simplistic, convey the intended message clearly but lack a bit of fluency and depth, leading to a moderate score in lyrical coherence."
There’s someone I can’t stop thinking about lately. I think I’m in love with them.,maybe lately maybe i ve been crazy but i think that you love me maybe probably it s permanent i love you totally maybe maybe i m in to spending every day together just with you lately lately i ve been thinking it could be forever just us two maybe when we re older i ll be less afraid maybe when it gets colder you could come to stay if i m with you,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,"The song's lyrics align perfectly with the user's emotional state of being infatuated and constantly thinking about someone, scoring a 5 in emotional alignment. The context of pondering a future and deeper connection with this person is also directly addressed in the lyrics, meriting a 5 in contextual relevance. The lyrics are mostly coherent and fluently express thoughts of love and future possibilities, though some repetitive phrases slightly affect the clarity, resulting in a score of 4 in lyrical coherence. Overall, the song is an excellent match for the user's feelings and situation, effectively capturing the essence of early-stage romantic contemplation."

My knees were shaking the whole time.,this one brought me down to my knees i had to hold onto the wall my knees shaking quivering my head feels like a frisbee,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"The song lyrics align well emotionally, capturing the physical sensations of weakness and nervousness, similar to the user's experience of shaking knees. Contextually, the song mentions a strong physical reaction which resonates with the user's description of being overwhelmed, though it lacks a direct reference to the cause of the stress (the 'huge' object or situation). The lyrical coherence is somewhat lower as the lyrics are a bit disjointed and abstract, making it harder to follow a clear narrative or message."
