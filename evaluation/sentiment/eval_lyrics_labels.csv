it s never easy to see the sun when you re locked up in this pretty plaster cage so she says she d love to feel alive again but this loneliness necessitates her void and i tell her don t stop trying to be the one because one day it won t matter who you are she s had enough of being down and it seems that everything that she s heard it s everything that makes her cry and it s just about time to get this right because i don t know if it s all about taking this drink tonight and i ve been thinking baby that you re out of your mind so now it s midnight and she leans against the wind she finds it cold and comforting in this bold and daring glow yeh we all know to pass the time we pass around a few cold stares and wonder who we are i think she s better off this way,sadness,disappointment
